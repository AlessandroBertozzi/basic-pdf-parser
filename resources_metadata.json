Currently dominant in medical discourse, the concept of self-management sees the responsibility for health and illness shift from the state to the individual . However, while this emphasis on individual responsibility and management has burgeoned, the role and status of partners and other family members in the management of chronic illness remains under-theorised. A need for greater attention to partners who live alongside those with chronic illness has been noted, including improved support from healthcare providers . This need is particularly pertinent in relation to the additional 'treatment burden' that accompanies a redistribution of the labour associated with illness management .",

Terms such as 'carer' or 'caregiver' have been heavily critiqued because they often imply passivity and dependency, thereby subordinating the care recipient and implying a position of incapacity . Conceptualisations of caring have tended to ignore the relationship in which care is experienced, treating caring as an activity which is de-contextualised from the reciprocity that forms the basis of many relationships . As  describe, the term 'carer' fails 'as a recognisable and valid description of the relationship between \"carers\" and those for whom they care. Furthermore, use of the term may imply burden and therefore devalue the individual who is cared for and in this way polarises two individuals who would otherwise work together' .",

This is especially necessary given that existing studies of caring have tended to neglect the experiences of male partners, and of couples in younger age groups, where the impact of chronic illness on, for example, reproductive decision-making, childcare, and intimate relationships may entail a different set of negotiations. This paper draws on a study of heterosexual couples' experiences of living with endometriosis, a common chronic gynaecological condition, to explore how male partners engage in its dayto-day management.",

Prevalence is difficult to estimate, but is generally thought to affect between 2 and 10% of women of reproductive age  and can have a significant impact on women's quality of life; detrimentally affecting work, social lives and relationships . Its symptoms include chronic pelvic pain, fatigue, painful sex, heavy and painful periods and subfertility. However, it is an enigmatic illness which is often misdiagnosed and takes an average of between 5 and 8.9 years to diagnose . Women with the condition report experiencing delegitimation of their symptoms by healthcare professionals and others, and uncertainty in terms of its trajectory . Given the absence of a cure and its uncertain trajectory, studies demonstrate the considerable burden that day-to-day management of endometriosis brings . It can also have a negative impact on relationships, and in some cases is reported to have contributed to relationship breakdown . However, having a partner can also improve quality of life  and women report that partners can be an important source of support . There exists a small number of studies on endometriosis that include male partners ) but most do not explore what partners do on a daily basis or the ways in which partners provide support .",

We draw on  seminal but underused paper 'Managing Chronic Illness at Home: Three Lines of Work', which utilised concepts from the sociology of work to theorise illness experience as a type of workundertaken by both individuals with chronic illness and their partners. They describe three main lines of work: illness work (comprising regimen work, crisis prevention and management, symptom management and diagnosis-related work); everyday life work (comprising daily tasks that keep the household going, housekeeping and repairing, occupational work, marital work, childrearing, sentimental work and activities such as eating); and biographical work, which are activities 'necessitated by the continual or occasional reconstruction of his or her life . Using the term healthwork is in keeping with previous work within the sociology of health and illness which recognises that work undertaken to maintain and promote wellbeing and to ameliorate illness is not only undertaken by paid practitioners but also by a range of social actors including those within the family domain . Research on endometriosis also demonstrates the considerable healthwork that women undertake and the associated acquisition of expertise and tasks of self-management . To avoid the privileging of practical tasks associated with this definition of healthwork, we also draw on theories of emotion work  to interpret and conceptualise affective aspects related to the management of chronic illness. We use the concepts of illness work, everyday life work, biographical work and add to these the concept of emotion work, to comprise 'healthwork' and to create an organising framework for the paper.",

Inclusion criteria were as follows: laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis; the presence of symptoms for at least a year and partners living together at the time of interview. Because the study sought to explore the impact of endometriosis on partners' shared everyday experiences, and particularly on aspects such as division of labour within the home and the everyday management of symptoms, it was felt that living together may provide male partners with a more intimate understanding and experience of endometriosis, as something they were 'living alongside'. However, it is recognised that couples living together will be diverse with regard to partners' levels of closeness and mutual involvement with one another. This strategy also excluded couples living apart who may have offered similar and/or different insights into the impact of endometriosis, as well as couples who had decided not to live together because of the strains of the condition.",

Interview questions were devised by referring to the literature and in discussion between the team and a specially convened stakeholder advisory group. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and entered into NVivo to aid analysis. A thematic analysis  was undertaken. One researcher (C.L.) drafted a coding framework, identifying apriori codes from the literature review and interview guide and inductive codes from the full dataset. Five researchers (L.C., N.H., H.M., E.D. and C.L.) then reviewed this framework in relation to a sample of the data (12 interviews) and amendments were made. A sample of data was then coded by two researchers (C.L. and H.M.), using the NVivo coding comparison function to measure inter-coder reliability, following which coding differences were discussed between the two researchers and the coding framework refined as a result. Separately, and following the thematic analysis, the data were also subject to dyadic analysis 2 to consider the relational aspects of the data in particular . Following the completion of the inductive thematic analysis, the thematic findings were considered deductively in conjunction with existing theories and concepts. The prevalence of men's descriptions of the various forms of support they provided and the 'work' they undertook warranted a consideration of how preexisting concepts of different types of healthwork  aligned with the data. Codes relating to management of the condition and its impacts as well as intra-relational support (e.g. 'self-management', 'support from male partner to female partner' and 'male partners' role in health care') were extracted and recoded manually by one researcher (C.L) using the concepts of illness work, everyday life work, biographical work and emotion work as new codes. In the following section, we draw on this analysis to illustrate the range of healthwork tasks undertaken by male partners of women with endometriosis exploring the ways in which men understand, make sense of and represent these practices. To maintain anonymity within the couple unit (i.e. to prevent participants from identifying quotes from their partner), we have refrained from using descriptive labels, identifiers or pseudonyms (see .",

I couldn't not let her do anything, because that was the wrong thing to do as well. It was a case of saying, 'look, OK you can do a little bit. You can walk up the stairs.",

For example, some men were seeking higher paid employment while other participants described lowering their expectations about spending money on leisure activities. Some men described how the impact on women's employment had impacted on the gender roles in their relationship, resulting in the adoption of more traditional gender roles: She wants to go out and get a job . . . she wants to earn her own money because at the moment if she wants anything, she has to ask me for money. We have accidentally become a traditional 1950s household, the man goes out to work all day and the little lady is at home! Alongside this, some men also reported feeling the added pressure of providing a larger share of the household income. Reference to a traditional imaginary of the 'male breadwinner' here is illustrative of the ways in which performances of healthwork may be mediated and shaped by wider social structures and relations.

Conceptualising the management of chronic illness as a form of 'work' makes salient, the agency of individuals and the social structures in which they are enmeshed, valorises and aids understanding of the actions undertaken in managing chronic illness, and captures the sense of distributed responsibility associated with such management . Significantly, this conceptualisation acknowledges that managing illness is difficult, messy and includes 'heavy' work, as well as the considerable burden associated with the ongoing management of life with a long-term condition . However, interrogations of healthwork, self-management and self-care have largely been applied at the individual level . Our data illustrate that men were engaged in a range of practices in support of their partners and that they often found this challenging and onerous. Healthwork allows a nuanced consideration of the distributed and relational nature of illness management, demonstrating that women were not managing endometriosis alone but were doing so in conjunction with multiple and specific activities undertaken by partners.",

Incorporating emotion work allows for a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of the process of managing illness and a greater understanding of the affective labour that male partners engage in when negotiating the complexities and relational contours of chronic illness and the impacts this may have on their own wellbeing. Such an approach offers a more adequate framing of these management activities in relationships characterised by love and mutual support. We suggest that the healthwork frameworkincluding emotion workis therefore a valuable and nuanced tool via which to understand the work carried out by significant others and family members, which focuses on the work they do on themselves and their intimate relationships as well as related practical, everyday life work.",

        "page_content": "Men's experiences have been insufficiently considered in explorations of the role of partners, family relationships and social networks in the management of chronic illness, and particularly in terms of their roles as partners. A small body of literature has explored men's accounts of chronic illness, describing men's attempts to maintain a sense of masculinity in a caring role , the use of discourses of strength and heroic resilience , and an emphasis on the importance of self-care for the achievement of control and invulnerability . These studies interpret men's responses to self-care and caring activities through the lens of masculinity, illustrating how this informs their approach to the management of chronic illness. While our data resonate with these findings, particularly in relation to men's use of a managerial approach in some contexts, our data also demonstrate an inclusive, affective approach to illness management, illuminating the complex, varied and contingent character of healthwork within heterosexual relationships. As we show, men were engaged in a diverse range of activities to support and assist their female partners. However, this is not to deny that some practices that men engage in may be problematic for women and this is of particular significance in the context of endometriosis. Some men described taking a more directive approach to management, describing themselves as bringing a 'logical' perspective or being best placed to make a judgement about the needs of their female partner. Existing research with women shows that they frequently report experiencing delegitimation about their symptoms (i.e. not being take seriously or being told that they are imagining their symptoms) in a range of contexts, including with healthcare providers . In this context, women are positioned as weak and irrational and selfcare seen as activity to rationalise and manage oneself (as opposed to simply managing the disease and its symptoms) . This includes working upon one's emotional responses and one's rationality, to achieve a valorised form of subjecthood ). Men's attempts to bring a logical or rational perspective to the management of endometriosis may therefore be considered as contributing to a wider set of gendered assumptions about the nature (and even very existence) of endometriosis as a condition, the authenticity of women's experiences and the legitimacy of their response to the condition. Some enactments of healthwork, which are situated in relation to ideas about male rationality, may therefore inadvertently reinforce notions that endometriosis is synonymous with irrationality and that women with endometriosis are inherently irrational.",

Investigating the role of partners, and the physical and emotional labour they engage in, is necessary to provide a fuller picture of what constitutes management of chronic illness and its treatment burden across the life course, especially for those in younger age groups where tasks may include caring for younger children. The data demonstrate that partners and family members respond to the expectation and impetus for non-medical management of chronic illness  and that this may be particularly pronounced in conditions such as endometriosis, where uncertainty and incurability makes non-medical management a central feature of the experience . However, the performance of these tasks and the level of support given within individual relationships can be diverse and contingent.",

We suggest therefore that more attention be given to the role and needs of family members in existing models and framings of self-management and call for an improved consideration by healthcare organisations and practitioners of the ways in which couples and families can be supported.",

Furthermore, the couples were in effect 'survivors' in relationship terms; it may be that these men were engaging in more supportive activity and healthwork than other male partners and as such they may not be representative of male partners of women with endometriosis more generally. The study was limited to heterosexual couples, and an exploration of healthwork in same-sex couples would add additional valuable insights. Finally, all interviewers in the study were female. It is recognised that the interview is a gendered encounter and that this will have had an impact on the interview dynamics. However, the precise implications are impossible to identify and a number of social signifiers can shape interviewer-interviewee relations .",

Črnčec and colleagues found three different approaches to measuring parenting confidence :  scales employing task-specific items tailored to specific child ages, (2) scales employing general items not linked to specific parenting tasks, and (3) scales employing a global approach that views parenting confidence as a part of a more stable personality trait that influences a range of tasks. As no task-specific assessment instrument was available in Danish for health professionals for measuring parenting confidence in parents of infants, we decided to translate and validate such an instrument for use in both research and clinical practice, namely the Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale (KPCS) . The KPCS was chosen because it was developed for clinical use with new families and specifically targets areas that new mothers worry about such as eating, sleeping and crying.",

Grounded in Bandura's self-efficacy theory, the KPCS is a task-specific scale for measuring perceived parenting self-efficacy (PPSE) . The KPCS covers the following themes that emerged through focus groups with parents and professionals: feeding, settling, establishing sleep routines, interpreting cries and cues, playing, communicating, responding to needs, management of minor illness, providing a stimulating environment and support from the partner. Designed to be simple to administer, complete, and score, it is therefore easy to use for both researchers and practitioners working within a clinical setting with parents of infants up to 12 months old .",

Concurrent validity was expressed as a medium to a high negative relationship, with both parental stress (PSS) and depression (EPDS) in concordance with the previous study  and our hypothesis. The nine-item version seems to work as well as the original 15 item version. The shortened version can, therefore, be used to place less burden on the mothers. Most mothers showed non-clinical levels of maternal confidence at both time points; only 1% showed severe clinical levels. As expected, significantly more families in the at-risk group compared to the not-at-risk group show clinical levels at both two and six months. A small number of families in the not-at-risk group do, however, show some level of clinical problems at both assessments. As the clinical levels based on Australian data may not be applicable to a Danish population, they must be interpreted with caution. The two cultures may differ regarding family norms, support offered to families with infants, parental leave, and other issues that may well influence parental confidence.",

As these measures are constructed for capturing a concept that is present in only a few parents, they are almost inherently skewed when applied to a community sample. Therefore, whether the observed skewness reflects the actual distribution of parenting confidence or rather item content and selection remains an open question. The KPCS's four response options (No, hardly ever; No, not very often; Yes, some of the time; Yes, most of the time) may also contribute to the ceiling effect. During the translation phase, some parents pointed out that they would have preferred being able to choose the options Yes, always or No, never. The omission of these options likely reduced the variation in responses. As parents said that the existing response options were not adequate, either revising the response options or adding more may be important.",

This could be caused by ceiling effects specific to this sample, but could also be because the risk factors used to generate the at-risk group do not capture all aspects of being a vulnerable mother. Interestingly, of the 50 intervention mothers, only 26 were in the at-risk group. While the 24 intervention mothers in the notat-risk group all had clinical levels of KPCS scores, they had none of the risk factors used for defining the at-risk group.

The fifth United Nations Millennium Development Goal (MDG) on maternal health aims to reduce maternal mortality by three-quarters between 1990 and 2015. This goal still remains a challenge in Africa due to the inability to reliably measure levels and trends of maternal mortality using existing health information systems.

Alternatively, those least likely to breastfeed their babies include those mothers who are in an ethnic minority, young in age, have less education, employed full-time, and have less social breastfeeding support .

The implication of viewing breasts as only a sexual component of the body has several consequences for women attempting to breastfeed that relate to the dynamics of the family and the woman as a part of society. The first implication of viewing breasts as only sexual objects prevents some women from being able to visualize the breasts as a means to provide nutrition for their baby . This prevents them from initiating breastfeeding because they have been taught by their culture that breasts are only sexual. Those women that can view their breasts as having a dual purpose for sexual relations and for breastfeeding might find that their husbands or partners discourage breastfeeding because the husband or partner cannot view the breasts as anything different than objects used in sexual foreplay . Some spouses and partners even develop a sense of jealously related to the infant because the breasts were objects that the spouse or partner thought of as theirs before the birth of the baby and do not want to share the breasts with the baby . These challenges can result in the mother choosing not to breastfeed to reduce the conflict that either she feels about her breasts or her partner feels about her breasts.",

This prevents women from being able to travel outside of the home because of their baby's demand for breastfeeding. A woman would have to pump before going into a public place in case her baby wanted to eat since breastfeeding is not socially accepted in many public venues. There have been instances where women have been asked to leave a public place such as a shopping mall or restaurant because they were breastfeeding their babies . Proponents to breastfeeding often point out that advertising images in the public often portray women who are scantly clothed; however, exposing one's breast during the act of breastfeeding is discouraged even though it is natural . As such, this contradictory view of breasts in western cultures is troubling for women who want to provide breast milk for their babies while doing their normal activities such as grocery shopping and taking children to the park.",

These laws differ from region to the next so it is important for women to be educated about their rights (Edelstein, Sharlin 2009: 76). Furthermore, women can help support other women in their desire to breastfeed and promote greater awareness in the public about the dual purpose of breasts so that breastfeeding can become a more culturally appropriate activity in public. Lastly, women can use methods of covering up in pubic or using discreet methods of breastfeeding when appropriate . Even so, methods that involve covering an baby and the breasts during breastfeeding in public or around anyone who is uncomfortable with breastfeeding can serve to only promote ignorance about breastfeeding and can a more difficult method to breastfeed where a mother cannot properly view whether her baby has latched onto the breast correctly due to the covering or due to the baby being unable to breathe adequately due to the covering.",

Since breastfeeding is less costly than formula feeding, some assume that the poor must breastfeed because they do not have the means to purchase formula. This is culturally significant because breastfeeding in some areas results in a dual stigmatization of poverty and breast milk that consequentially leads to less women desiring to breastfeed. However, even this cultural barrier is changing as the effects of modernization and marketing of infant formula in third-world countries result in less women choosing to breastfeed as more people in the world have access to formula than ever before in human history .",

These hurdles come in multiple forms however concentrate on the idea of perceived hardship that a mother will face if she chooses to breastfeed over bottle feed with formula. Some of the more common psychological reasons for a women who choose not to breastfeed include having an embarrassment regarding the act of breastfeeding, having a lack of confidence in the ability to breastfeed, having a fear that breastfeeding will result in less freedom, having a fear that the woman's body cannot produce an adequate supply of milk, having a fear that breastfeeding will results in breasts that are unattractive, and fear that breastfeeding is painful .",

The mother feels that the negative beliefs that prevent her from breastfeeding are real, and this further promotes an environment and circumstances where breastfeeding becomes an impossible activity. Only by reexamining a negative belief about breastfeeding that might turn out as false, can a woman overcome her own barrier to breastfeeding. This can be achieved by reflecting back on where the belief was picked up whether or childhood or through television programming and evaluating honestly to oneself if the belief about breastfeeding makes sense or is even true . Having a good understanding of the breastfeeding process through education either by healthcare professionals or by actively seeking reading material through books or online can prove to be enlightening.",

Many women do well with breastfeeding while on maternity leave however find that the growing demands and pressures of the workplace leave little time for fostering the breastfeeding relationship at home and for pumping breast milk at work. Consequently, this is when many women who were previously successful in breastfeeding give up and turn to infant formula as the answer to their breastfeeding crisis.

This is true especially during the first six weeks after giving birth where establishing a mature milk supply is most important for continued breastfeeding success , 2014: 140). The prolonged periods of separation that constitute work also contributes to women choosing formula since greater periods of not breastfeeding often result in a decreased milk supply since the act of breast milk formation operates on a supply and demand cycle .

Businesses can furthermore ensure that women have adequate time to pump their breast milk by allowing them sufficient breaks that align closely to what the baby's schedule .

Jednakże u progu XX wieku coraz więcej kobiet zaczęło stosować sztuczne metody karmienia. Obecnie wiele kobiet nadal preferuje tego rodzaju metody zamiast naturalnych, nawet pomimo kosztów, jakie trzeba ponieść w tej kwestii, oraz szeregu kampanii promujących zdrowe karmienie dzieci. Dalsze badania tego problemu wskazują na szereg powodów, dlaczego kobiety nie wybierają karmienia piersią. Co więcej, wybór sztucznego pokarmu postrzega się jako barierę wobec zbudowania zdrowej relacji łączącej matkę oraz dziecko. Bariery niesprzyjające upowszechnieniu się praktyki karmienia piersią można podzielić zaś na kilka kategorii: biologiczne, kulturowe i psychospołeczne. Bariery biologiczne wynikają z różnic o charakterze anatomicznym oraz fizjologicznym pomiędzy kobietami i ich dziećmi uniemożliwiających skuteczne karmienie piersią. Dopiero od niedawna istnieją metody zabiegów chirurgicznych, które owe różnice niwelują. Paradoksalnie, pojawiły się też nowe bariery natury biologicznej, wynikające z rozwoju medycyny i związane z interwencjami chirurgicznymi podczas samego porodu. Można je jednak przezwycię-żyć, stosując inne metody chirurgiczne. Opieka medyczna może udanie promować karmienie piersią poprzez edukację na rzecz zalet zdrowotnych wynikających z tej metody, udzielać informacji na ten temat, redukować liczbę niepotrzebnie wykonywanych cesarskich cieć i współtworzyć większe możliwości dla matek decydujących się na naturalne metody karmienia. Do barier kulturowych zaliczyć z kolei możemy te przeszkody, które wynikają z modelu kulturowego, w jakim funkcjonuje dana kobieta, oraz jej uwarunkowań rasowych czy religijnych. Wyniki badań w tym zakresie sugerują, że częściej skłonne do karmienia piersią są białe kobiety w wieku około 30 lat, posiadające co najmniej wykształcenie średnie, zamężne i posiadające średni dochód. Przeciwnie rzecz ma się w przypadku młodych kobiet pochodzących z mniejszości etnicznych, słabo wykształconych, zatrudnionych na pełen etat i nieposiadających wsparcia społecznego w tej materii. Do przypadku barier psychospołecznych zaliczyć należy problem kobiet, które świadomie wybierają sztuczny pokarm. Bariery te można dalej podzielić ze względu na konstrukcję osobowości matki oraz aspekty społeczne odnoszące się np. do roli młodych matek w społeczeństwie współczesnym. Dodać należy, iż oba ta aspekty przenikają się nawzajem. Przykładem takich barier może być niechęć wielu kobiet do karmienia piersią w miejscach publicznych. W świetle powyższej typologii, stwierdzić możemy, iż pomimo tego, że karmienie piersią dostarcza dziecku pełnowartościowego i naturalnego pokarmu, nadal w gestii samej matki pozostaje wybór, jaki rodzaj pożywienia dostarczy ona swojemu dziecku. Dzięki przezwyciężeniu zarysowanych powyżej problemów i barier możliwe jest spopularyzowanie naturalnych metod karmienia także w dobie szybkiego rozwoju społeczeństw zachodnich.",

Since its appearance, the life of the global society has been completely disrupted due to the particular characteristics of the pandemic, the causative agent and the restrictive public health measures implemented to curb its transmission . . Thus, a preparedness and response strategy plan has been implemented with the aim of guiding the public health response to COVID 19 on a global scale and providing practical guidance to prevent indirect morbidity linked to the disease. Pandemic, namely the complications associated with late seeking of care and the increase in non-chronic diseases following the interruption of care. In this sense, a vigilance and health security strategy has been put in place to combat the negative repercussions of this pandemic on the population in general and on vulnerable groups in particular. Thus, certain areas have deserved priority attention in order to protect the categories most exposed to infection by the Sars-CoV 2 virus, in particular pregnant women due to physiological and immune changes, which increase their sensitivity to respiratory infection. In this context, maternal and newborn services must face emerging needs during this pandemic to ensure on the one hand the continuity of prenatal health services and postnatal care and on the other hand to promote and protect breastfeeding whose health benefits for both mother and child have been widely documented in the scientific literature. Indeed, breastfeeding in the context of the pandemic has aroused the interest of the scientific community and several studies have been conducted to explore the impact of the pandemic breastfeeding practices. Although some studies have confirmed the absence of the sarscov-2 virus in breast milk , the practice of breastfeeding and its sustainability during this pandemic have been the subject of several questions in connection with the transmission of the virus through respiratory secretions from the infected mother or during breastfeeding . Thus, this situation can lead to fears and a state of stress in nursing mothers accentuated by other psychological and psychocial stressors linked to the pandemic and to the preventive measures taken to limit its spread. As a result, the disruption of mental health can cause nursing mothers to refuse to give this biologically valuable fluid to their infants and subsequently to discontinue this practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Morocco, with regard to other countries, has not escaped the negative repercussions of this perinatal health crisis despite the early and multisectoral response arrangements (security, health, economic and social) undertaken following the appearance of the first local outbreak. In addition, there are no national data describing the current state of knowledge and practices of pregnant women in the prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2 during the postnatal period. It is within this framework that this work falls, which represents a first Moroccan study, carried out at the beginning of the pandemic and dealing with this problem. This study aims to assess the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic, on the one hand, on breastfeeding knowledge and practices and on the other hand, on the mental health of breastfeeding mothers.",

This great ignorance is explained by the characteristics of the pandemic and its causal agent, but also by the absence of definite scientific information on its mode of transmission. The latter was the subject of several questions at the beginning of the pandemic and several scientific works including meta-analyses by Fenizia et al, Flaherman et al, Knight et al and Walker et al reported that vertical transmission is a rare phenomenon . Cases of transmission during the third trimester and particularly during the 14 days prior to delivery were reported by a study that examined transmission in 936 SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and found that 3.2% (95% CI: 2.2% to 4.3%) of neonates were infected with SARS-CoV-2 immediately after birth or within the first 48 hours . Nevertheless, our results remain similar to a study that reported that the level of knowledge of pregnant women remains low and far from reality and this seems to be associated with an indirect effect on the psychological anxiety and stress of pregnant women . For the association between the knowledge of pregnant women about SARS-CoV-2 infection and sociodemographic parameters, the results showed a significant correlation between women's knowledge, their level of education and their professional status ( p <0.001). Our results are similar to those of the study conducted in Colombia which showed significantly higher knowledge of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy in women with a higher level of education and a higher socioeconomic status. . In addition, data from the literature have shown the existence of a positive correlation between intellectual level and understanding of educational material  as well as health-related behaviors . The level of education also influences the level of understanding and appropriation of public health messages . Concerning practices of mothers, our survey showed that the percentage of early breastfeeding during the first half hour (53.4%, table ) considerably exceeded the percentage reported in a similar single-center study carried out in the same hospital center with a percentage of 11.4% . In addition, almost half of mothers have practiced skin-to-skin contact with their infant (43.1%, Table ) and the majority of mothers plan to breastfeed exclusively until 6 months and even continue breastfeeding until 24 months. This is probably the result of national health strategies to promote breastfeeding and the development of recommendations to support this practice. In this context, UNICEF-Morocco has supported the Ministry of Health since 2018, through an integrated quality management of newborn health through interpersonal communication sessions for behavioral and social change on the main themes of maternal and child health, in particular early childhood development and breastfeeding promotion.",

        "page_content": "In terms of application of the recommendations, which aim at protecting against infection and transmission of the virus, we found that more than three quarters of the breastfeeding mothers had knowledge of the means of protection and the rules of respiratory and body hygiene. This high level of knowledge can be explained by the educational role of the media and social networks in this context and by the early implementation of major awareness campaigns, which aim at providing accurate, and reliable information to the general public regarding the prevention of Sars Cov 2 infection. Nevertheless, we noticed that the practice of these rules is observed only in 38.3% of the mothers for the use of the facemask and in 42.2% for the practice of respiratory hygiene. Consequently, more than half of the mothers did not respect these rules of protection despite the high level of knowledge found in our study. This finding may be related to the stress of mothers in this pandemic context, that the raison why we have explored in this second part of our work the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of breastfeeding mothers. Thus, the analysis of the psychological survey using the PCLS tool revealed that 45.7% manifested a state of post-traumatic stress. This result is a normal consequence as fear, worry and stress are normal responses of any person facing a real threat such as natural disasters and epidemics. Therefore, it is understandable that pregnant women are vulnerable to mental health problems especially at the beginning of the declaration of the Covid 19 pandemic, a period during which information about the virus and the infection was very limited and uncertain. Which seems to be consistent with our results since our study was conducted at the beginning of the declaration of the pandemic. On the other hand, some studies conducted immediately after the declaration of the pandemic revealed that psychological disorders are more frequent in women compared to men, which further increases the vulnerability of pregnant women to mental disorders . At the same time, data from the literature have reported that pregnant women experience moderate to high emotional distress related to pregnancy-related stress and stress related to fears of perinatal COVID-19 infection . Indeed, according to the results of study that addressed vulnerability to covid-19 stress in 4,451 pregnant women in the United States, almost 1/3 reported high stress related to unpreparedness for pregnancy due to the pandemic and the same proportion exhibited fear of perinatal infection . Simultaneously, several authors have reported that the effect on women's mental health during pregnancy and infancy is an important aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic . Thus, women are at increased risk of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress, accentuated by new stressors related to the preventive health measures of the pandemic, such as physical distancing, isolation at home . The psychological outcomes of the pandemic on pregnant women at the beginning of the pandemic was also highlighted by a study conducted in Italy which showed that the COVID-19 epidemic had a moderate to severe psychological impact on pregnant women . According to the results of this study, more than two thirds showed higher than normal anxiety and almost half of the women reported high anxiety related to vertical transmission, which explains to some extent the state of stress found in our study since almost three quarters of our women had no knowledge about vertical transmission of the virus (Table ). Furthermore, our study revealed a significant association between posttraumatic stress and certain social determinants of health such as level of education, mother's profession and social economic level, which explains the high prevalence of post-traumatic stress in our study population. Indeed, the analysis of our results revealed that the psychological impact of the pandemic was more accentuated among illiterate women or those with a low level of education, among housewives and among women with a low or average economic income (Table ). This finding is consistent with the magnitude of the problem given the social, economic and intellectual profile of our group, which highlights other stressors related to the economic and social consequences of the pandemic, including financial difficulties and increased interpersonal stressors . The results of our study were limited by the single center design. Nevertheless, it represents a first experience that allowed the exploration of the impact of the Covid19 pandemic in perinatality in a Moroccan context.",

In other words, if women achieved FMU or home birth, they seemed likely to plan this in future. Similarly, those who planned OU births (or AMU births so they would be close to OU), and went on to give birth in an OU, tended to plan the same in future, whether they had a complex or straightforward labor and birth. This was the case for most, but not all, women, and clearly many factors contributed to these preferences in addition to clinical risk profiles.",

Our findings challenge the notion that women will be more open to non-OU birth in future pregnancies, even after straightforward OU births. Nulliparous women reappraised their antenatal expectations as na€ ıve or unrealistic following an OU birth; in postnatal interviews, these respondents described having set aside their hopes for a \"natural\" birth, instead preferring to opt for the apparent security  . Van Teijlingen et al raise an important methodological issue, arguing that data from posing hypothetical questions is hard to interpret because women have not normally experienced the \"alternative\" under discussion, and we acknowledge that this aspect is a limitation of our study . As Dahlen et al observed, women experience first births as \"novices reacting to the unknown\" . In our study, none of the nulliparous women who considered birth to be risky during their pregnancies described birth as less risky than they had anticipated after the event, and several considered it to be more risky overall. However, Downe et al show that women giving birth in OUs are more likely to experience interventions such as augmentation or epidurals, and in our longitudinal interview data, OU birth experiences appeared to diminish women's belief that \"natural birth\" was possible for them . This creates a difficult dilemma for maternity care providers; to help prevent disappointment and feelings of failure, nulliparous women need to receive realistic information about labor and birth , but providing this information may unintentionally perpetuate the idea that birth is risky and unpredictable, and that planned OU birth is the best option given the uncertainties that women face.",

The concern with these \"risky choices\" eclipses the far more widespread situation where healthy nulliparous women, and multiparous women with straightforward obstetric histories, plan to give birth in OU settings . This aspect might also be framed as a \"risky choice,\" because it is now well established that women with lowrisk pregnancies who plan birth in OU settings have a higher likelihood of birth interventions, including a cesarean delivery, compared with similar women who plan non-OU births .

The longitudinal narrative approach used here revealed how risk perceptions could be reinforced by birth experiences, but our findings are exploratory and larger scale research is needed to examine the extent to which the observations described here pertain to a wider maternity care population. It would also be valuable to conduct qualitative studies with longer follow-up periods, to determine whether individual women's postnatal perspectives altered over time, or in response to subsequent pregnancies.

Women are more open to birth in non-OU settings in first pregnancies, and first pregnancies may therefore provide a golden opportunity to support and promote planned birth in non-OU settings, particularly midwifery units. To facilitate broader uptake, these services need to be presented as \"normal\" or \"usual\" by clinical staff, and the benefits of birth in non-OU settings should be presented alongside other information such as likelihood of transfer.",

While the Birthplace study  found increased adverse perinatal outcomes for planned first births at home, planned first births in midwifery units (freestanding and alongside) were as safe as planned OU births for babies. Given that intervention rates are lower and normal birth rates higher in all non-OU settings , it is in women's best interests to offer alternative settings for birth unless OU birth is clinically indicated. If it is indeed the case that heightened risk perceptions lead some women to plan OU births, then these settings are likely to remain the preferred option for some, even after \"normal,\" uncomplicated births in first pregnancies. In addition to facilitating access to non-OU settings for first births, attention should shift toward understanding the reasons for high intervention rates for women who elect to give birth in OUs, and increasing support for normal birth in hospital OU settings.",

However in 2004, a WHO review of relevant evidence concluded there was no clear cut-off for overweight and obesity for those of Asian ethnicity, and thus WHO did not change their current BMI guidelines . They did, however, identify trigger points of > 23 kg/m 2 and > 27.5 kg/m 2 , representing increased and high risks respectively for public health action. In practice, BMI categories commonly used in China  are underweight BMI < 18.5 kg/m 2 , normal weight 18.5-23.9 kg/m 2 , overweight 24-28 kg/m 2 and obese ≥28 kg/m 2 . In Korea, the classifications are underweight BMI < 18.5 kg/m 2 , normal weight 18.5-22.9 kg/m 2 , overweight 23-25 kg/m 2 and obese ≥25 kg/m 2 . Studies from Taiwan  and Japan used WHO BMI categories  despite Japanese Society of Obesity guidelines that define obesity at a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 . The European Board and College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (EBCOG)  notes difficulties in accurately comparing prevalence of prepregnancy BMI groups internationally with heterogeneity of data sets. However, comparison is important across regions to inform our understanding of relationships between GWG and pregnancy outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only systematic review comparing prepregnancy BMI and exploring relationships to GWG and health outcomes across international settings. We have compared Asian studies using regional and WHO BMI categories in assessment of prepregnancy BMI, GWG and pregnancy health outcomes to explore applicability of regional and WHO BMI categories in applying IOM GWG guidelines.",

The Journal of the American Medical Association editorial accompanying our recent data analysis on GWG discussed barriers to healthful lifestyle intervention during pregnancy in addressing GWG and improving health outcomes . Barriers included inadequate evidence of improvement of adverse pregnancy outcomes and modest changes in GWG. Yet, the largest individual patient data (IPD) analysis of 36 randomised controlled trials in pregnancy (~12,000 women) , recently published in The BMJ, demonstrates that even modest reduction in excessive GWG improves outcomes, reducing caesarean section, preterm birth and GDM, the latter being particularly modifiable with physical activity intervention. Reported results were independent of maternal characteristics including age, BMI, parity and ethnicity, enhancing generalisability of the findings. It appears that even modest changes to lifestyle and GWG effectively reduce adverse health outcomes, affirming the need for implementation of healthful lifestyle in routine antenatal care for public health impact .",

Overall, 16% of Chinese women were underweight, 74% normal weight and 9% overweight and obese. These values are lower than those of recent cohort studies, where 15-28% of reproductive-aged women in China are above healthy weight . This contrasted with Japan, with 18%, 71% and 11% respectively. In China 53% of women gained above GWG guidelines consistent with the USA and Europe. In Japan GWG below guidelines was 64%, with only 7% above. These differences arguably occur because WHO BMI categories were applied in Japan. Differences may also relate to ethnic variation. In Singapore, difference in GWG between ethnicities was postulated to be due to difference in diet quality and psychosocial factors . However we postulate that the degree of observed difference primarily related to application of BMI categories. Asian studies have already suggested the need for specific guidelines . In 2000, Chinese-specific guidelines for GWG  were developed, but have not been commonly adopted, with most Asian studies using mainly Caucasian-derived IOM GWG guidelines . A call has been made for multi-centre collaboration to create optimal GWG guidelines for Asian women using modified BMI categories . Here however, we demonstrate that applying regional BMI categories generated GWG patterns and health outcomes similar to those in the USA/Europe. With regional BMI categories, apparent higher risks of macrosomia and caesarean section were demonstrated. Overall our data are reassuring for clinicians and policy makers that IOM GWG guidelines are applicable in women of Asian background, provided regional BMI categories are used, to avoid overestimation of GWG below recommendations that are not accompanied by increased risks of adverse outcomes.",

For the meta-analysis, we combined the USA and Europe into one group, due to inadequate reported outcomes. Within each study there may be heterogeneity regarding race/ethnicity, and results should not be interpreted that the sample represented the country of origin. The European and Asian studies did not provide demographic data, and we have assumed the populations in these studies to be largely homogeneous. Studies from the USA do include some women from Asia, and where reported proportions are small, reporting is inconsistent, limiting capacity to interpret the overall prevalence of Asian women in US and European studies. Preterm birth was not adjusted for gestational age, potentially resulting in less total gestational weight gain than would have been otherwise attained. Meta-analyses for GDM could not be performed due to deficiencies in the primary data sets. Heterogeneity among studies may affect the reliability of the results, although this was only relevant for the effect of GWG below guidelines in SGA and LGA in USA/Europe. Lastly, we included studies published before 2009 IOM guidelines, so treating physicians and midwives may have had different GWG targets and guidelines compared to studies from after that time.",

However, in our sample approximately 30% of females with FEPM had been exposed to sexual abuse; a rate of trauma that is of concern. A relationship between sexual abuse or traumatic experiences and the onset of psychotic disorders has been proposed , and this association may be stronger in females than males . Exposure to such trauma, may negatively affect brain development, through chronic hyper-reactivity of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This hyper-reactivity may then lead to disruption in the functions of dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, and may worsen prognosis. Such events sequelae have been described in the \"traumagenic neurodevelopmental\" model. Although the ultimate alterations to functions in dopaminergic and serotonergic may precipitate the onset of FEPM, there may be broader long-term effects. In females with chronic bipolar disorder, a history of sexual and physical abuse/trauma may relate to poorer mood outcomes such as more shifts in polarity and mixed episodes . Exposure to sexual abuse might also place females with bipolar disorder at a disproportionately greater risk of comorbid anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) . Because our cohort was young, the possibility of the development of such (generally) longer-term sequelae might not have been captured in this group.",

Numerous strategies were adopted in the current study to minimise the impact of such limitations including: (i) medical files at EPPIC were systematised according to FEP guidelines ; (ii) medical files were rated by two consultant psychiatrists with expertise knowledge of EPPIC and the treatment of FEP; (iii) sound inter-rater reliability was determined for clinical and functioning measures; and (iv) concurrent validity of psychoses and baseline SUD was established for a subsample of patients .

The union consisted of a small group of physically impaired persons, and their goal was to eliminate institutional care for persons with disabilities and to ensure their full participation in social life, independent existence, professional activity and ability to make their own choices in life  .",

Supporters of the gender-reform feminism want women to have, the same as men, the possibility of full participation in all areas of social life. Lober identified four types of the gender-reform feminism, primarily focusing on changing the existing forms of femininity and masculinity. These types are: liberal feminism, Marxist feminism, socialist feminism and \"Third World\" (so-called developmental) feminism. Supporters of the gender-resistance feminism focus mainly on the differences between female and male ideas and experiences. The researcher stresses the fact that in order to do away with male dominance, women must create their own organizations and communities. In this category, Lober includes: radical, lesbian, psychoanalytical and stand-point femisisms. The last, gender-rebellion feminism, also referred to as the \"third wave\" of feminism, departs from the conceptualization of biological gender and cultural gender, which are typical of the first and second waves of feminism. The genderrebellion feminism opposes the dominant constructs of cultural gender and it consists of the following trends: multiracial feminism, men's feminism, social constructivism feminist, postmodern feminism and the queer theory  .",

There was a breakthrough in the early 1980s, associated with Gwyneth Matthews' study based on interviews with 40 disabled women. Next, in 1984, the US President's Committee on Employment of the Physically Handicapped developed a report confirming the unequal status of disabled women in terms of education and professional activity compared disabled men. In 1985, Marry Deegan and Nancy Brooks published an extensive monograph. Eleven of its chapters were fully devoted to the disability of women, lack of information on their life and experiences, and the need for change in their living conditions that contribute to the consolidation of social inequalities experienced by disabled women  .",

They define disability from the social rather than the medical perspective. Disability is a cultural interpretation of human changeability, not \"innate inferiority\", \"pathology to be cured\" or \"undesirable property to be eliminated\" 21 . According to Rosemarie Gerland-Thomson, feminist disability studies: first of all, tend to avoid medical diagnostic categories of disability. They analyze in what way persons with a broad range of physical, intellectual and emotional differences are excluded and presented as \"deficient\" by the abled society. Secondly, they use a precise language that may very often seem intricate. They use the term \"properties that we consider disabled\" rather than words like \"deformations\" or \"anomalies\" 22 . The author shows that the purpose of her first use of the term \"feminist disability studies\" was to combine the feminist theory with disability research. In her article Integrating Disability, Transforming Feminist Theory, Gerland-Thomson observes ______________ 20 Antonina Ostrowska notes that such obstacles as limited activity on the labor market, stereotypes, prejudices, negative emotions, problems with communication, higher costs of living or social passivity may be encountered by both men and women. However, disability research and analyses show that, in the case of women, this is a much more discriminatory factor than in the case of men. She discusses the topic in more detail in: A. Ostrowska that \" integrating disability as a category of analysis and a system of representation deepens, expands, and challenges feminist theory\"  . Gerland-Thomson notes that the integration of disability with the feminist theory is generative, broadens common enquiries and questions the existing assumptions concerning disability. The researcher is in the front of recognizing feminist disability studies as a domain with separate methodology. Their goal is to prevent prejudices, understand disability as a politicized problem and build a community for all. The claims that feminist disability studies want to abolish stereotypes concerning disabled persons and their main goal is to undermine the dominant assumptions about the life of persons with disabilities  .",

It seems contradictory that, on the one hand, women with disabilities are considered sexless but, on the other hand, they are more exposed to sexual abuse than abled women. More in: C.J.

Hence, the cognitive frames of self-efficacy and attitudes toward disciplining seem to intertwine with each other and synchronously effect children's development.

        "page_content": "In accordance with the literature, we presume that maternal self-efficacy is linked to children's behavioral consequences . Self-efficacy in essence is the actors' view on their ability to act in a certain desired way, which brings about a satisfactory outcome ). In the current study, self-efficacy will be considered as the mother's perceptions regarding her own competence to discipline children . The influence of selfefficacy in a deprived environment is much more salient than its influence in a safer environment . Indeed, if the mother feels confident in her parenting skills, she provides protection and a sanctuary place for her child from outside threats. Therefore, focusing on the Arab society, which is characterized by high rate of poverty and unemployment , we hypothesize that maternal self-efficacy regarding disciplinary behavior is an important factor to take into consideration when addressing children's behavioral difficulties. A recent study has found that Arab mothers, who reported lack of competence in their parenting skills, were more likely to report behavioral maladjustment among their children than mothers who reported higher levels of self-efficacy . Patently, children who do not receive clear guidelines and direction from their mothers, are at risk of displaying behavioral and emotional difficulties. A mother who feels secure in her ability to monitor and control her child's behavior directly influences his competence by modeling . Indeed, it has been found that mothers with high self-efficacy function as role-models for their children which, consequently leads to their children feelings competent . On the other side of the continuum, mothers with low self-efficacy may not have the motivation or the skills to monitor their children's behavior. Thereby, these mothers may lose grip over their children's actions which, in turn may lead their children to function in a maladaptive manner. Interestingly, parents with low selfefficacy tend to view their children as difficult, which, ultimately may become a selffulfilling prophesy . Thus, these children may act accordingly to the way their parents view them and therefore, low self-efficacy of the mother may elicit conduct problems. Furthermore, children with mothers who feel lost and dread in their parenting skills report more symptoms of anxiety than children with mothers who feel confident in their parenting skills . It is likely that these children experience confusion and uncertainty by the way their mothers express their love, which seems conditionally . Therefore, children who are raised by mothers with low self-efficacy may also be more inclined to develop internalizing behavior such as, symptoms of anxiety and emotional problems than children who are raised by mothers with high self-efficacy.",

        "page_content": "Understanding the formation of attitudes and perception concerning disciplinary tactics is essential in understanding its influence on display of behavior . Mothers' propensity to view force as a legitimate act of discipline is likely to facilitate behavioral and emotional difficulties among their young children. Particularly, mothers who support the use of physical punishment are likely to transfer their attitudes to their children , which in turn may elicit their children's susceptibility to perform an act of violence. Resorting to hostile attributions and attitudes legitimizing aggression as a disciplinary tactic consequently, may lead to violent acts not only on the part of the caretaker, but equally on the part of her child ). When parents believe in authoritarian control strategies as a way to discipline their children, the risk for their children to abuse others increases . Thus, maternal attitudes approving corporal punishment are likely to increase their child's externalizing behavior. Similarly, approving the use of corporal punishment by the mother may trigger further negative consequences such as, depressive feelings and anxiety among their children. Naturally, approving the use of corporal punishment ultimately results in its use. The use of corporal punishment has been linked with depressive symptoms among Jewish and Arab students who reported high levels of exposure to physical punishment by their parents . However, there is a lack of evidence regarding how attitudes toward corporal punishment and its use affect internalizing behaviors among children, especially among young children. This study will attempt to fill this gap by exploring the effect of mothers' attitudes toward corporal punishment on young children's internalizing behavior and whether this relationship is mediated by the use of corporal punishment.",

In accordance with these findings, within the Arab society, exposure to corporal punishment is more frequent among boys than girls and boys show lower levels of internalizing behavior compared to girls . The use of physical punishment among boys is often perceived as normative which may buffer the negative outcome physical punishment may have on Arab boys . However, the use of corporal punishment may more likely elicit externalizing behavior among boys than among girls, since they are more exposed to it and therefore may be likely to imitate their caregivers' behavior. Girls on the other hand, may be more likely to develop internalizing behavior rather than externalizing behavior in response to corporal punishment. The use of physical force on the female's body is regarded as deplorable within the Arab society . Therefore, when corporal punishment is enforced on Arab girls its effect may be traumatic and likely to trigger negative emotional reactions. We postulate that the impact of corporal punishment will be stronger on externalizing behavior than internalizing behavior among boys while, the impact of corporal punishment will be stronger on internalizing behavior than externalizing behavior among girls.",

The DDI was translated into Arabic by professional translators and was widely used among Arab mothers in the past (see Khoury-Kassabri 2010; Khoury-Kassabri and Straus 2011).

The behaviors include the use of physical force to discipline children (e.g., \"you will hit the child on the hand or buttocks\").

The study used a representative sample of Arab mothers' reports on their young children's behaviors within the Arab society, a traditional culture yet cultivated within Israel, a modern culture . The study addressed first whether the likelihood of use of corporal punishment mediates the relationship between self-efficacy and attitudes and both externalizing and internalizing behaviors, and then whether there is a gender difference in the effect of corporal punishment on children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors. With respect to the effect of maternal self-efficacy, it was found that mothers' use of corporal punishment partially mediated the relationship between maternal self-efficacy and children's externalizing behavior. Indeed, a previous study has shown that low selfefficacy among mothers was directly linked ) to externalizing behavior. The current finding on the indirect link of self-efficacy via corporal punishment to levels of externalizing behavior suggests that mothers who feel they lack the capacity to discipline their children are likely to facilitate externalizing behavior among their young children through the use of corporal punishment as a result of their inexperienced incompetence to discipline their children. Consistent with previous studies, mothers' feelings of incompetence and helplessness may worsen children's developmental process by rereinforcing their need to retaliate and seek their parents' attention by exhibiting conduct problems . In fact, among the predictors of daily stress and marital discord, maternal self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of toddlers externalizing behavior . The current study shows that maternal selfefficacy is not only an essential maternal characteristic in children's development it is also a characteristic that is likely to predict the use of corporal punishment by mothers. The use of corporal punishment in turn is associated with children's display of externalizing behavior. Previous studies showed that self-efficacy is especially imperative among societies characterized by a low social economic state , which is often the case among Arabs living in Israel.",

While previous studies have stressed the influence of low maternal selfefficacy on children's conduct problems , little is known regarding the influence of maternal self-efficacy on children's internalizing behavior. This study attempts to fill this gap. Interestingly, low maternal self-efficacy is associated with internalizing behavior in the same way as externalizing behavior, indicating the important role maternal self-efficacy may play in the development of not only children's behavioral but also their emotional problems. Although, there is a lack of evidence concerning the association between self-efficacy and children's internalizing behavior especially among young children within the Arab society, this study shows that Arab mothers with low self-efficacy are likely to directly enhance their children's internalizing behavior as well as by means of corporal punishment.",

With respect to externalizing behavior, our results were consistent with this supposition. In fact, the relationship between attitudes supporting corporal punishment and children's externalizing behavior was fully mediated by corporal punishment. Within the Arab society, from a traditional point of view, corporal punishment is considered normative . Therefore, attitudes supporting corporal punishment are prevalent in comparison to western societies (Khoury-Kassabri 2012). Our results suggest that Arab mothers who support corporal punishment are more likely to actually use it, and thereby are likely to enhance their children's externalizing behavior. Indeed, children who are raised by mothers who support the use of corporal punishment and subsequently apply it, are a risk of imitation their mothers' behavior in this regard. Hence, these children may be inclined to view aggression as a legitimate solution to various conflicts and consequently use it in their everyday life. In terms of internalizing behavior, consistent with our expectation and given the limited available literature, we found that corporal punishment mediates the relationship between maternal attitudes toward corporal punishment and children's internalizing behavior strictly by means of corporal punishment. A possible explanation for the current finding is that attitudes supporting corporal punishment naturally predict the use of corporal punishment which, in turn, is likely to elicit children's internalizing behavior. Therefore, mothers' attitudes supporting the use of corporal punishment may enhance the developmental of children's internalizing behaviors. Thus, it appears that the effect of attitudes towards corporal punishment on children's emotional problems is dependent on whether the use of corporal punishment will be inflicted on children by their mothers.",

This is particularly interesting as studies show that girls are more likely to demonstrate internalizing behavior while boys are more likely to demonstrate externalizing behavior in response to corporal punishment in their early teens . It is probable that in our study the children react similarly to the use of corporal punishment because they are still in the early stages of their development. A possibility is that sex differences in internalizing are not yet as salient as they become later in development. This may indicate the impact of harsh ways of socialization through which girls learn to suppress their feelings and boys are encouraged to express theirs  may only become visible later on in the elementary school period. Therefore, future studies should replicate this unique trend. Additionally, it may well be that mothers' reports of their children's behaviors effect this current trend because mothers who use corporal punishment view their children as problematic and therefore, report symptoms of externalizing behavior more often than internalizing behavior among their children independent of the child's gender.",

Because the current study is cross-sectional, no conclusions on the direction of the demonstrated associations can be drawn, nor on the causality of the relationships. Although we examined the theoretical link between maternal self-efficacy and attitudes toward corporal punishment on the use of corporal punishment and its link to children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors, the direction of the mutual influence between these variables as assessed through mediation analyses poses a common problem. It well may be that parents who have children with behavioral and emotional problems, feel less capable in disciplining their children because of these problems, and therefore show insufficiencies in their parenting strategies as expressed by the use of corporal punishment which further elicits their children's behavioral problems . Future studies should test the causality of the association between maternal characteristics and children's behaviors by longitudinal and experimental studies. Furthermore, maternal characteristics and children's behaviors in the current study are assessed only from the mothers' perspective because the study is based on mothers' reports. Due to this limitation, it is possible that children's behaviors reports are biased especially in cases where mothers use corporal punishment . Therefore, future studies should collect other informants' assessments such as, teachers, fathers or use other methods such as, observations. Furthermore, in this study, because of the sampling method, we were able to calculate only the response rate of the whole sample, but not in different groups. Finally, this study investigated the influence of mothers' characteristics on their children's development with the exception of their fathers. In fact, a study investigating the influence of parents on their adolescent children among the Chinese families has found that the relationship between father and child was more important in influencing family function than the mother-child relationship . The Arab culture is similar to the Chinese in the sense that the father takes the control over the decision making in the family. However, today the structure of the Arab family is changing as mothers are more educated and independent as opposed to the older generation. This in turn may affect the role the father takes in his children's lives (Haj-Yahia and Lavee 2017). It will be interesting to examine the position of the father in the modern Arab family and how it influences children's developmental process.",

Next, additional studies are needed to examine the association between maternal self-efficacy, attitudes toward corporal punishment and children's internalizing behavior specifically. It is interesting to examine whether Arab children are more inclined to develop internalizing behavior in response to maternal self-efficacy and attitudes toward corporal punishment than children from western societies. Additionally, information gathered from both teachers and their caregivers is potentially more reliable as mothers' as well as teachers' perspective on their children's behaviors provides an additional perspective. Further, the use of other methods such as, observations may provide additional perspective on the way mothers' characteristics affect their children's emotional and behavioral attributes.",

It is therefore, expected that preventions and interventions targeting the mothers' ability to feel competent in her parenting skills may affect their tendency to use corporal punishment and by consequence also prevent the development of their children's problem behavior. This is especially imperative within the Arab community where certain mothers are forced to often deal with their children's misbehavior singlehandedly , and particularly, these are the mothers who use corporal punishment . Additionally to maternal self-efficacy, beliefs in the use of corporal punishment effect children's externalizing behavior by means of the use of it equally for boys and girls. In the Arab society, girls are often considered as weak and therefore, are likely to develop internalizing behavior in response to harsh disciplinary tactic. However, this study shows that girls at kindergarten age react similarly to boys, and specifically they are equally likely to develop externalizing behavior than internalizing behavior in response to corporal punishment. This, in turn may raise awareness and subsequently information as to why girls particularly Arab girls exhibit externalizing behavior. Previous studies have stressed the deleterious effect corporal punishment has on children's development . Interventions should provide Arab mothers the skills and parenting techniques which will help mother's to understand the impact of their behavior and guide them with effective coping strategies. Finally, it is important to mention that in early development parents have substantially more power over their children's developmental process than in later development. Indeed, the findings show that maternal selfefficacy and maternal attitudes toward corporal punishment are associated with children's behavioral and emotional problems within the Arab society among young children. Henceforth, interventions aimed at Arab mothers should start when their children are in their early age.",

This longacting reversible contraception (LARC) is cost-effective,  with high continuation and satisfaction rates  and few contraindications to its use.  It also has added benefits of either being non-hormonal and as effective as emergency contraception (the copper intrauterine device [IUD]) or can be used to reduce menstrual blood loss and endometrial proliferation (the levonorgestrel-impregnated IUD). Despite these benefits, the last decade has seen little change in the proportion of women using intrauterine contraception,  as many eligible women still do not choose this method, perhaps because of their anxiety about pain associated with the insertion procedure. The scientific literature suggests a continued search for a pharmacological means of reducing pain associated with IUD insertions. Recent studies have investigated misoprostol,  lidocaine,  nitroprusside,  and prophylactic ibuprofen,  and there are plans to use inhaled nitrous oxide (Entonox ®22 ). There is little recent research into women's pain anxieties about the insertion of an IUD.  The expectation of pain can influence the actual pain women experience during their IUD insertion.  Information and preparation prior to IUD insertion has been shown to reduce anxiety and eventual pain experienced by women during their procedure.  Under current practice women receive counseling but the effect on women's experiences and satisfaction with intrauterine contraception insertion needs further exploration.",

In a similar study conducted by Goldstuck and Matthews 27 in 1985 on nulliparous women, expected pain was significantly higher than actual pain experienced (measured 3 minutes post-insertion), as for our study. Although the devices used in that study, the Copper 7 ® and Copper 7-mini ® , are less commonly used in practice today, the inserter diameter is comparable. Of note is that the pain scores obtained in our study were higher than those reported nearly three decades ago, despite use of local anesthesia for our cohort. The studies are both limited by small sample size and sampling techniques and are not directly comparable. However, any increase in pain experienced by women having IUD insertion compared with those three decades ago may reflect a change in pain perceptions or a difference in readiness to report pain and discomfort over time. Difference in the insertion techniques is also likely to be a factor and the use of local anesthetic universally in our study does not appear to have counteracted this effect. As yet, there is no evidence that Instillagel ® significantly reduces pain with IUD insertion, although a preliminary randomized study found Instillagel ® to be effective for IUD insertion pain if it is allowed at least 5 minutes to take effect.  However, Instillagel ® was only allowed 2 minutes to take effect in our study.",

However, expected pain has been found to be a significant predictor of pain with IUD insertion,  and may in fact be suggestive of anxiety prior to the procedure. Counseling prior to IUD insertion, including time to answer questions and less formality, discussing what to expect as well as pain-reducing and coping strategies, have been shown to reduce anxiety and pain experienced with procedures.  All the women in this study were counseled prior to IUD insertion, and irrespective of age, race, parity, or having previously had IUD insertion, still appeared to have a high expectation of pain prior to their procedure, suggesting that women experience high levels of anxiety in relation to IUD insertion.",

ARTs have facilitated the separation of genetic and gestational motherhood; they have allowed people with very limited fertility to reproduce; they have increased the number of cases in which parents and children are not genetically related to each other. A few things however have stayed the same. So far, every child ever created has had two chromosomal parents-one of each sex. Success in current research in reproductive genetics however might change this. A few years ago, mice were conceived using genetic material from two males , and some scientists claim that both the generation of viable eggs from males and of sperm from females are feasible in human reproduction in the future . Hendriks et al.  describe a number of pathways towards the development of in vitro derived gametes in a systematic review published in 2015. They identify 9 biologically plausible routes that could lead to the development of artificial oocytes in males and 9 biologically plausible routes that could lead to the development of artificial sperm in females. According to Hendriks et al., clinical application is the expected outcome of this research. However, they note that the state of knowledge concerning functionality and safety of human in vitro derived gametes is still preliminary. Currently, research towards obtaining human gametes in vitro from other types of cells is ongoing in several labs around the world .",

Such a prospect has been met with controversy and has been termed ''the ultimate incest'' : a catchy phrase much cited in the British media in 2008. The prospective use in human reproduction of in vitro gametes, and in particular the derivation of eggs from male cells and of sperm from female cells, is looked upon with scepticism in the scientific community. In 2008, the Hinxton Group (a group of scientists and other experts, constituted at the initiative of the Stem Cell Policy and Ethics Program and the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics), issued a statement according to which (a) It is likely to be very difficult to derive eggs that could be used for reproduction from XY (chromosomally male) cells. (b) There are biological and technical reasons that will make it even more difficult, or even impossible, to derive sperm that could be used for reproduction from XX (chromosomally female) cells .",

Should this be the case, it could be of significant interest to people who currently view their reproductive options as being limited or non-existent. The ability to create eggs from somatic cells from males, and sperm from females, could offer same-sex couples the possibility to become (genetic) parents together . Another possible use is that of creating gametes from one person's cells and using them in reproduction with her own gametes. The use in reproduction of eggs from cells from men and sperm from women would create new legal and social challenges, and solo reproduction would be still more challenging.

Since no-one is able to reproduce naturally without a partner, there is no obvious place for solo reproduction in medicine. Yet, as we have argued elsewhere , it is frequently the inability to fulfil one's reproductive aspirations that drives people to the fertility clinic, rather than any specific medical disorder. The fulfilment of these aspirations depends partly on one's circumstances. A woman may seek in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) because of her husband's incapacity to reproduce, even though she could reproduce unaided with a different partner. For this reason, the question to ask is not so much 'who needs' this technique, but 'who might want it'?",

But this is not always possible. For someone who does not specifically wish to have a child genetically linked to any other individual apart from herself, the possibility of solo reproduction may be highly appealing. One group of potential users could be couples in which one of the partners is unable or does not wish to reproduce or is at risk of transmitting a serious genetic condition to their offspring. Single individuals might likewise see merits in using only their own genetic material. In both cases, people might prefer to avoid having to deal with the legal and social ramifications of gamete donation and with whatever other problems might come via someone else's DNA. Given the current significance with which genetic connections are invested in our societies-which includes the perception of genetic progenitors as a child's real parents -having a child with the help of gamete donation is a challenge for life. Whether or not the parents are open with their children about their conception, whether or not the donors are known, the donation is rarely a one-off event that families can simply put behind them: it can affect the relationship between the parents, the parents' relationship with their child, with their extended families, and with society in general . Some of the reasons in favour of solo reproduction via in vitro created gametes may coincide with some of the reasons in favour of reproductive cloning: in the words of Lee M Silver writing in the context of reproductive cloning, ''why should I put unknown, unneeded, potentially diseasecausing genes into my child when I don't have to?''

One of the most cited accounts of reproductive autonomy, John Robertson's, is rooted in biology and genes. According to Robertson, there is a 'basic biologic […] drive to have a biologically related family' . Similar ideas can be found in policy documents.

Although Harris does not fully articulate his reasons for categorising cloning as reproduction it seems reasonable to infer that it is primarily because reproductive cloning, like 'natural' reproduction, involves the transmission of genes from adult to child, with the intention to then rear that child. The WHO took a diametrically opposing stance, describing reproductive cloning as replication rather than reproduction and claiming that because it was not really reproduction it should be forbidden . Human reproduction, it has been argued, is essentially collaborative and sexual, whilst cloning is not sexual and can be non-collaborative (when genetic material from only one person is used), and thus is more akin to manufacture than reproduction . Furthermore, the embryo obtained through reproductive cloning is and is not an embryo, depending on how we define ''embryo'': on the one hand, it is not because it does not arise from conception (the union of gametes); on the other hand it is, because it has the potential to develop into a human being . Likewise, it could be argued that solo reproduction with in vitro gametes is not a form of reproduction and thus is not protected by reproductive autonomy. Indeed, solo reproduction would not precisely match what we mean now by reproduction. However neither did IVF or embryo transfer or other forms of altering the natural process of human reproduction. It is difficult to see why instead of regarding the established content of a definition as strictly unchangeable, we cannot look for the broader reasons why we would call something reproduction: for example, because it is a process through which someone becomes a (genetic) parent.",

We do not prevent people who carry genetic diseases that they risk passing on to their children (such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease) from reproducing. Most of us would not claim that it is unethical for them to do so-and few of those who would argue that it is, would take the additional step of claiming that they should be prevented from reproducing. Would the risks associated with recessive mutations in solo reproduction outweigh these risks? We must remember that we are talking about risks rather than certainties here. All pregnancies are risky; many parents risk passing on deleterious genes, or reproducing in socio-economic circumstances that are associated with a higher incidence of disease or difficulty to the resulting child . Moreover, procedures such as ICSI and IVF are themselves known to be risky: a meta-analysis shows a 29 % increased risk of major malformation in offspring born as a result of these techniques, when compared with natural conceptions . Yet these risks seem to be regarded as acceptable collateral damage both by clinicians and patients. This is not to deny the biological complexities involved in reproducing with oneself. It is known that reproduction between close relatives increases the danger that offspring will inherit harmful mutations. These risks would be significantly magnified if an adult reproduced with him or herself, as it were. Solo reproduction would be akin to reproducing with one's own identical twin. For many this might seem a sufficient reason to prohibit it. However, we suggest that the prospect should not be dismissed too hastily. Although it is well known that incestuous reproduction is risky, the exact degree of risk is hard to ascertain, and may be overstated . A report published in 2011 suggests that the risk of congenital anomalies in first cousin marriages is 1.7-2.8 % higher than the background population risk . Solo reproduction would probably be more risky than this-but the question of whether these risks are excessive, especially in comparison with already elevated risks of IVF and ICSI, cannot be a given. If, as John Harris suggests, risk is the sole ethical basis on which it may be justifiable to limit reproductive freedom, further work would need to be done to establish the degree of risk associated with solo reproduction in comparison with other, already accepted, reproductive techniques.",

Genetic testing for autosomal recessive mutations could be carried out. Also, as we are looking at future possibilities, and at cases in which reproduction would take place in a clinical environment, there is nothing to prevent a very vigilant process of gamete and embryo screening, and prenatal diagnosis (PGD) could be used routinely in these cases. As pointed out by Palacios-Gonzales, Harris and Testa, ''it is fair to expect that by the time that the prospect of IVG [in vitro gametes] for human reproduction is considered, we will have a grid of markers and assays to prospectively isolate the IVG that are most likely to result in viable healthy offspring. And it's fair to note that this level of scrutiny is not even comparable to the one that accompanied the first-in-human application of IVF'' . Part of the appeal of in vitro created gametes is that they can be collected, multiplied and manipulated easily, and without risk or invasive procedures to the patient. So although the process is undeniably complex and costly, it would not be unrealistic to suppose that the risks could be brought within acceptable limits. (Testing and discarding large numbers of gametes and embryos might in its own right seem ethically questionable. However, the routine creation and disposal of surplus embryos is already an integral part of assisted conception in many countries where IVF is provided.)",

It also concerns family relationships and confusion of roles within the family and potential for abuse in unequal relationships (such as that between a parent and her offspring), parental responsibilities towards children (such as refraining from seducing one's offspring) and the significance of trust in one's upbringing, etc. Elective sterilisation or the possibility to successfully employ fertility treatment to avoid genetic mutations in offspring resulted from incest do not therefore entirely defuse objections against incestuous unions. Solo reproduction is incestuous in one sense: the parent reproduces with the most closely geneticallyrelated person possible. However it exemplifies none of the problems outlined above. It might be criticised, like reproductive cloning has been before it , for displaying a form of narcissism and refusal of collaboration in reproduction: what is so good about your genes and so bad about mixing in anyone else's that could make you want to reproduce with yourself? It may be that a person who would seek to be an only genetic parent may be embarking on such a journey with arrogant ideas about her own genetic structure. However, as we suggested above, this is not necessarily so: one might have reasons other than a love of one's own genes to prefer to avoid donor gametes.",

However, the exact 50-50 balance is not in fact a fixed feature of natural human reproduction, since a greater genetic contribution comes from the mother: offspring inherit the mother's mitochondrial DNA as well as her chromosomes. Human reproduction is thus already genetically slightly unequal. In turn, this has made it possible recently to create offspring whose mitochondrial DNA is provided by a different woman from the chromosomal mother. Such individuals are the product of three adults' genetic contributions. Even where there are only two genetic contributors, there can be variation, whereby offspring inherit more chromosomes from one parent than from the other. These anomalies can happen spontaneously in natural reproduction, and the imbalance can favour either the father or the mother . The main point here is that we already have 'natural' births that involve a higher proportion of chromosomes from one parent. It is not always 50-50, and the imbalance does not necessarily lead to drastic health problems in offspring. Whether there is a threshold beyond which significant harm would be caused, remains to be established.",

According to this principle, when a choice is available, parents should choose the embryo that is most likely to have the best life. In its original formulation, the principle does not extend to a claim to outlaw the instances in which it is violated: so this objection would not suggest a need to outlaw the use of solo reproduction. Moreover, the principle has been formulated in the context of embryo selection where to exercise choice means simply to choose the 'best' embryo. If all the embryos are created using the solo parent's cells, the PPB could be easily fulfilled by choosing the 'best' embryo from among those created. However, if we attempt to apply the PPB to the decision to embark on solo parenthood at all, it can easily be short circuited. The parent need only claim that they will either engage in solo reproduction, or forego reproduction altogether. Since the PPB does not demand that people forego reproduction, it would not therefore effectively rule out solo reproduction.",

Thus, there already are (genetic and gestational) 'mothers' who are their children's fathers-if we equate male parent with father. A large and growing body of research indicates that what matters most for children is family functioning (the quality of relationships in a family) rather than family structure (the number, sex, or sexual orientation of the parents, whether or not parents and children are related genetically to each other) . More specifically regarding the gender of the parents, results have been slightly better when the parents were a lesbian couple , and also in the case of adoptive gay father families , than in the case of families with two parents of different gender.

It is not that the other genetic parent is uninvolved in their upbringing or is unknown or has died: there is not, and there has never been one. The child might still acquire a second social or legal parent, but not a second genetic parent. Genetic relatedness, the capacity to recognize one's traits in others and to learn one's family history are valuable experiences: so much so that, according to the philosopher Velleman , intentionally alienating children from their biological relatives by creating them with donor gametes is immoral. Having knowledge of, and contact with, two branches of genetic relatives, can enrich one's personal identity. Solo reproduction, while not estranging the child from genetic relatives, limits this possibility. An adopted child or a child born via anonymous donor gametes or who is estranged from her biological relatives may hope to find them, whereas nothing may be done in this regard for the child of solo reproduction.",

Furthermore, prospective parents via solo reproduction may be acting out of a set of socially encouraged beliefs that the genetic connection between parents and children constitutes a necessary, or even the fundamental, ingredient of parenting. Yet fertility treatments are currently being used to enable people to become parents genetically. The implications of such an objection would need to reach all these other cases as well. It would be inconsistent to continue to support some people in their quest to have the genetic component in their reproductive endeavours, and deny it for others. The holding of a geneticised account of parent-child relationships is not intrinsic to solo reproduction, or to the preference to reproduce genetically, in general: as we have seen above, one may have a variety of reasons to prefer to reproduce in this way, many of which do not rely on prospective parents acting out of such a belief.

In adult medicine, advance care planning (ACP) is increasingly being acknowledged as a way to improve patient-centered care at the end of life.  ACP is a formalized process of discussing a person's values and preferences for care, aiming to guide future healthcare decisions. Pediatric advance care planning (pACP) is internationally recommended and welcomed by healthcare providers.  It can increase children's (where applicable) and parents' capacity to anticipate decisions, support family coping, provide peace of mind, increase sense of control, and reduce suffering.  Yet, prior studies have shown that professionals experience practical barriers to pACP and that many pACP discussions occur belatedly, in particular, after acute crises.  From the perspective of professionals, major challenges are the uncertainty when and how to raise these sensitive issues, unclear prognoses, unrealistic expectations by parents, concerns of undermining hope, and parents' hesitation to engage in pACP. Moreover, many pediatric patients are too young to express their treatment wishes and surrogate decisions by parents carry a high emotional burden.  After having explored these issues in a previous study with healthcare providers,  we aimed to investigate parents' experiences and views in order to identify their needs and barriers to pACP.",

Although not legally binding, ADs are often completed in pediatric palliative care settings with parents (\"parent AD\") and children (if possible) to identify and communicate care preferences and to guide care providers in their decisions. Parents were invited to tell their experiences with their child's care. In particular, two key questions were asked: (1) whether and how professionals had discussed with the parents possible future challenges and decisions in advance and (2) whether and where parents see possibilities to improve pACP. Optional supplementary questions helped to obtain more details about the planning process and parents' experiences, for example, questions on the timing and content of discussions, the participants, written documentation, and on what parents found helpful/difficult. At the end of the interview, participants could add anything else they found important. The following sociodemographic information was collected: parents' age, gender, and profession; child's gender, illness, date and place of death, age at death, and number of siblings; and completion of an AD.

To gain new insights from each case, we successively analyzed each interview in detail, creating new codes and revising existing codes where necessary. To structure the data, each passage was assigned a descriptive code (label) to note the basic topic. Evaluative codes were used to note participants' qualitative comments (positive, negative, and recommendations) about a topic (e.g. pACP conversations). Each created code was described in detail in a memo. Four iterative steps of analysis were performed: (1) independent first-cycle coding of each transcript by the two coders: evaluation coding of participants' qualitative comments, (2) recoding of each transcript and integration into a common coding scheme in joint data sessions, (3) review and revision of the coding scheme, and (4) second-cycle coding: reorganization of the evaluative codes into needs, barriers, and recommendations for practice.  A detailed protocol of the coding process is available from the authors.",

        "page_content": "pACP is often misconceived as giving up hope, and pediatricians are worried about taking away hope through pACP.  Our results highlight that holding on to hope is important and might facilitate parental engagement in pACP. Parents can remain hopeful and still understand their child's serious condition.  Honest conversations can even support hope,  allowing to define alternative aims and hopes, for example, hope for quality time together, quality of life, spiritual wellbeing, normality, a good day, or no suffering.  Our results suggest that this approach needs to be applied to pACP. Hope should be directly addressed in pACP conversations in order to elicit realistic hopes and make meaningful plans, following the principle \"hope for the best, prepare for the worst.\"  Our data underline that pACP should encompass different elements: (1) crisis and end-of-life planning, (2) planning for the living, that is, addressing wishes and needs during life, and (3) planning of farewell and funeral. Since previous work suggests that physicians tend to mainly focus on medical information,  they should be encouraged and trained to address non-medical aspects of a child's life with a severe illness. Written material and the involvement of non-medical professionals (e.g. social worker, chaplain) may be conducive to this aim. Some pACP tools for families and professionals already meet these requirements.  The parents in our study emphasized the importance of a continuous main contact person in the care of their child. This need has already been addressed in previous work and been stressed by healthcare professionals.  Our results underline that pACP requires a \"case manager\" who can build a trusting relationship with the child and the family, lead the conversations, coordinate care, communicate care plans, and can be called in critical situations to support parents and professionals. However, as a 24/7 availability of one person is unrealistic in practice, this function might, for example, be assigned to specialized pediatric palliative home care (SPPHC) teams where available. 30 An important finding was that parents had little interest in creating an AD. This contrasts with prior studies concentrating on the benefits of and requirements for written ADs.  Healthcare providers attach much importance to consensual pACP documents, in order to feel more secure in critical situations.  Interventions aimed at improving pediatricians' communication skills as well as professionals' and parents' understandings of pACP might help to reduce parental distress and avoid conflicts related to ADs.  Additionally, age-appropriate tools may be useful in order to include the children in the process.  Emergency plans were considered necessary for specific settings such as emergency departments and hospital wards with changing staff. Previous work also shows that frequent emergency department visits increase parents' interest in creating a written care plan.  Parents and professionals agree that specific medical emergency plans might be useful, similar to the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) that have become common in adult care.  However, this study and others show that intensive care and emergency physicians do not always accept such documents.  Professional education on pACP and a \"case manager\" as main contact might help reducing uncertainty and increasing acceptance of such documents.",

A limitation of our study is that our interviewees were recruited by the help of personal contacts of M.F., which may have biased the results. However, none of the parents had known the interviewer beforehand. Most families had been supported by a SPPHC team; therefore, our study may not match the needs and barriers relating to pACP in other care settings when families receive less support. On the other hand, the experience with pediatric palliative care may also have enhanced the parents' knowledge about pACP. Additionally, the retrospective design may still underestimate barriers to pACP because in retrospect parents may be more aware of the benefits.",

However, some differences were identified between mothers and fathers with regards to the reasons why they controlled their emotions during the subsequent pregnancy and after their second child was born: mothers solely focused on protecting the (un)born child, whilst fathers in addition also took on the role as the main support of their partner during pregnancy. Fathers reported challenges with finding the space to grieve and it appeared that mothers and fathers also expressed their grief qualitatively differently. As the baby continued to live, parents reported that the sense of uncertainty gradually decreased and it appeared that with time, fathers? roles as the main support for their partners became less necessary, possibly allowing the opportunity to grieve. Furthermore, despite at times feeling challenged by their partner? s grieving style, mothers and fathers reported greater mutual understanding and mutual support within their relationships.",

The high level of anxiety and worries of both parents about their baby's wellbeing during pregnancy as well as after birth implies that support should be offered to normalise and contain these fears. O? leary and Thorwick  recommend support groups, preferably held in a mainstream setting, which would allow parents time to process the challenges around attachment and grief and also normalise their experiences.",

Some parents may require additional support during subsequent pregnancy and the postpartum period to prevent the development of attachment difficulties (O? leary and Thorwick) . Cote-Arsenault et al.  outline a model of nursing care for support for women during the subsequent pregnancy-providing a safe and supportive environment through home visits, teaching anxiety management techniques and facilitating diary writing. Further research into interventions supporting both parents is required. Interventions involving mindfulness practices may provide a model of care which is supportive for clients experiencing a traumatic loss, as well as the healthcare professionals providing the support (Cacciatore & Flint) . However, further research is required to evaluate these interventions with this client group.",

It is commonly held  that ART has dissociated procreation from sexuality -just as the advent of the pill dissociated sexuality from procreation . My study will show, on the contrary, that although ART does indeed dispense with sexual intercourse, the physical dimension of sexuality related to the circulation of bodily substances is far from having disappeared from these new modes of reproduction. Furthermore, sexuality is not actually confined to a physical level involving the meeting of bodies or even the meeting of bodily substances. It also comprises a level of psychological mechanisms that are still present in these modes of procreation. I use the concept of sexuality in its psychoanalytic meaning with its implications of adultery and incest, which I have found significant in understanding the social and personal stakes involved in medically assisted reproduction (MAR).",

This is not so much the case in Roman Catholicism, which closely associates sexual intercourse and procreation, and consequently forbids all forms of MAR, whether between spouses or involving third parties. The instruction to believers issued in 2008 justified the forbidding of MAR for this reason, replacing the term 'sexual intercourse' with the circumlocution the 'conjugal act':",

In Islam, the prohibition of plenary adoption or of procreation using a sperm donor shows that ties of descent are partly determined by biological ties, whether these are real or presumed.

Any union between two people related by milk kinship through breastfeeding is considered incestuous and is therefore prohibited (ḥaram)  This risk of incest explains why Islam forbids human milk banks, even if the topic is debated between Islamic scholars, especially between Shi'i scholars . In addition, breastfeeding creates a kin relationship between the infant and the wet nurse's husband, who is considered to be at the origin of the production of the mother's milk. If a woman breastfeeds a child that is not her own, this child is prohibited from marrying not only the children of his wet nurse, but also the children of all former wives of his wet nurse's husband -even though these women did not breastfeed him. The children of the wet nurse's husband become milk brothers and sisters because they have ingested the 'milk of the stallion', according to the expression used in Islamic jurisprudence . The fact that the infant becomes milk kin not only to the wet nurse, but also to her current husband and to the men she may subsequently marry while lactating implies that these men are held to be at the origin of the milk. The relationship emphasized between sperm, milk and agnatic descent further explains why the husband's brother is also prohibited from marrying the child who receives the milk. It sheds light on the complex relationship between sperm and milk from the moment of conception through lactation itself .",

In Jewish law (halakha), adultery is clearly defined as sexual relations between a married Jewish woman and a Jewish man who is not her husband. This definition implies that if the man with whom a Jewish wife has sexual intercourse is not Jewish, there is no adultery in the strictest sense of the term. Transposed to the case of sperm donation, some rabbis therefore conclude that adultery is only committed if the donor is Jewish . Consequently, using sperm from a non-Jewish donor circumvents the problem of adultery in Judaism.

The predominant position, based on biological relations, is that a child's Jewishness comes from the woman who carries and gives birth to him or her , and not from the woman who donated her egg, and that it is the womb that determines the Jewishness of the child. This explains why egg donors can be non-Jewish, whereas gestational surrogates, authorized in Israel, must be Jewish . In addition, they must be single (including divorcees and widows) to avoid adultery, again in accordance with the definition of this concept that excludes unmarried women. Consequently, a child born to a Jewish woman is necessarily Jewish, even if the child was conceived from an egg donated by a non-Jewish woman .",

Women who physically experience donor insemination can, at times, find it difficult to accept this third person in the relationship. Despite the lack of a sexual act and penetration, these difficulties arise from the fact that the sperm of an unknown person has penetrated their bodies, leading some women to experience 'the intrusion of a foreign body inside them'. Some women claim that they feel 'soiled' by this sperm that they have to accept inside themselves instead of and in the place 'reserved' for their husband's sperm. As a result, they experience donor insemination more or less unconsciously as a transgression of the concept of fidelity .",

In my research, issues concerning adultery, incest and descent have been shown to be significant for couples who involve a donor in the reproductive process, because they raise the question of what this third party represents for the couple. Attempts to distinguish ART from sexuality appear to be misguided given that sexuality in all its dimensions, including the physical dimension of the circulation of bodily substances as well as the psychological dimension of fantasy, is far from having been removed from new methods of reproduction, even if they do indeed dispense with sexual intercourse, because sexuality cannot be reduced to the sexual act.",

The term early ejaculation is used to replace premature ejaculation, a term considered relatively inaccurate and pejorative. Early ejaculation is the ejaculation that occurs sooner than desired, either before or shortly after penetration, over which the sufferer has minimal or no control. Like all or most other dysfunctions, this is primarily a self-reported diagnosis. Delayed ejaculation is the undue delay in reaching a climax during sexual activity. Anejaculation is the absence of ejaculation during orgasm . The major problem in assessing the prevalence of early ejaculation is lack of an accurate (validated) definition. It can be defined by time of ejaculation, in the context of the sufferer's or partner's satisfaction, the number of penile thrusts after intromission or even in the context of the amount of sexual stimulation. Similarly, there is lack of definition for the delayed ejaculation. The highest prevalence rate of 31% (men aged 18-59 years old) was given by the NHSLS study in the United States . In the sub-groups aged 18 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 years old, the prevalence was 30%, 32%, 28% and 55%, respectively. These high prevalence rates may be a result of the dichotomous scale (yes/no) in a single question asking whether the ejaculation occurred too early or not.",

The disease caused by Corona has affected all countries, and its global spread as an epidemic has become a problematic issue. One of the issues that increase this concern is the unpredictability of the disease because no specific time has been predicted for the end of this epidemic . Due to the corona virus epidemic, the components of mental health that may be affected is anxiety. Anxiety in patients with respiratory disorders is chronic and can significantly reduce patients' quality of life . Anxiety about covid-19 is common and it seems to be mostly due to the unknown and creating cognitive ambiguity in people of this virus. Fear of the unknown reduces the perception of safety in humans. It has always been a source of anxiety for humans. About Covid-19, the lack of scientific information also aggravates this anxiety . Anxiety can weaken the body's immune system and make them vulnerable to diseases, including Corona (Chang, Ling, & Wen, quoted by Alipour, Ghadami, Alipour & Abdolahzadeh, 2019). As a result, due to the rapid spread of this disease and the lack of realization in this field, it seems necessary to research to help identify this disease and especially the anxiety created and ways to deal with it. It can also help improve people's quality of life and society's health .",

        "page_content": "As mentioned, the quality of life is among the things that are affected by the anxiety of Corona . Quality of life is defined as people's understanding and feeling that their needs are met and the opportunity to reach their wishes and desires is not lost. Quality of life is multidimensional, which is a combination of cognitive (satisfaction) and emotional (happiness) factors . It includes physical, psychological, social, spiritual dimensions, symptoms related to illness or changes related to treatment . In general, quality of life is one of the words that does not have a clear and uniform definition, although people understand its meaning easily. But as mentioned, this concept is not the same for them . According to the World Health Organization's definition, quality of life is people's understanding of their position in life in terms of culture, the value system in which they live, their goals, expectations, and standards. Therefore, it is a completely subjective issue and cannot be seen by others and is based on people's understanding of different aspects of life . Another thing that is related to Corona anxiety is parenting. The term parenting is derived from the root prio meaning lifegiving. . Parenting refers to the dominant way of raising children by parents and significantly impacts how children grow and develop their personalities. Developmental psychologists have always been interested in studying how parents' educational methods influence the development of children's social abilities   Salmani, 2015). The three parenting styles are authoritative, in which parents have logical and wise expectations while controlling their children logically. In this model, expectation and responsiveness are both at a high level. Authoritarian style in which parents have a lower rank regarding logical control. They are less close to their children and emphasize the use of power and forced discipline. A high expectation level and a low level of responsiveness characterize this pattern. In the permissive style, parents do not control their children and do not expect them to behave wisely and do not teach them to be independent and selfreliant. This model is characterized by a high level of responsiveness and a low expectation level (Yousfi, Amani and Babaei, 2015, cited by Tahmasebnejad & Arian, 2020). Some researches that have been conducted on the quality of life of people suffering from corona anxiety show that these people have a lower quality of life from the perspective of an external observer. The results of another similar research show a statistically significant inverse relationship between Corona anxiety and quality of life. In this way, the higher the anxiety about Corona, the lower the quality of life, and the lower the anxiety about Corona, the higher the quality of life .  showed that parenting methods are parents' concerns during the Corona era, which is an important factor in predicting Corona anxiety. Considering the lack of research in this field and the contradictions that exist in previous research, this research intends to answer the question, can the anxiety of Corona be predicted based on the quality of life and parenting methods? Materials Corona Virus Anxiety Questionnaire (CDAS). This questionnaire was created by  during the corona virus epidemic. This scale has 18 items and 2 components (factors). Items 1 to 9 measure psychological symptoms and items 10 to 18 measure physical symptoms. This tool is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (never = zero and always = 3). The reliability of this tool was obtained using Cronbach's alpha method for the first factor of 0.879, for the second factor of 0.861 and for the whole questionnaire was 0.919. Correlating this tool with the GHQ-28 questionnaire was used to check the validity of the correlation with the criteria of this questionnaire. The results showed that the Corona anxiety questionnaire with the total score of the GHQ-28 questionnaire and the components of anxiety, physical symptoms, impairment in social functioning and depression are equal to 0.483, 0.507, 0.418, 0.333 and 0.269 respectively (Alipour, Gadami, Alipour & Abdallah Zadah, 2019). World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHO). The quality of life questionnaire was developed by the World Health  in order to examine the quality of life of people, which was designed and translated into different languages simultaneously in more than 15 countries. This questionnaire contains 26 questions and measures 4 areas: physical health, mental health, social relations and environmental health. Two questions do not belong to any of the areas and evaluate the health status and quality of life in general. The questionnaire has a range of 5 options, which respectively have the options \"very dissatisfied with score 1\" to \"very satisfied with score 5\". Finally, the lowest score that any person can get is 26 and the highest score is 130. A higher score indicates a better and higher quality of life (Karami, Ahmadi, Qobadi, 2021). In the Psychology of Woman Quarterly/2022 / Volume 3/Issue 2 study of Levy and Litman-Ovadia (2011), the reliability of the above questionnaire was calculated using three retest methods with an interval of three weeks, halving and Cronbach's alpha coefficient equal to 0.67, 0.87, and 0.88, respectively. The validity of this tool was verified by the method of differential and structural validity and was reported as acceptable .  reported the reliability and validity of this questionnaire as 0.73, 0.89. In Iran, this questionnaire has been translated and standardized by Nejat, Montazeri, Holakoui Nayini, . The reliability of the questionnaire was measured using Cronbach's alpha and intra-cluster correlation obtained from the retest, and it was found to be above 0.7 in all areas. However, in the field of social relations, the value of Cronbach's alpha was 0.55, which can be due to the small number of questions in this field or its sensitive questions. Nasiri (2006) used the concurrent validity method to determine the validity of the scale. He measured the relationship between the total score of the test and its subscales with the total score and subscales of the general health questionnaire through the correlation coefficient and reported it as favorable (Karami, Ahmadi, & Ghobadi, 2021).",

        "page_content": "Bamrind Parenting Style Questionnaire. 30-question parenting methods questionnaire (Bamrind), the initial form of this questionnaire has 30 items, which was designed and made by Diana Bamrind . Of which 10 questions are permissive, 10 are autocratic and the other 10 are related to parenting. This scale is scored from 0 to 4 (Saatchi, Kamkari and Askarian, 2010, quoted by Taghvaei, 2018). In a study conducted by Esfandiari in 1995 to investigate the possibility of changing the parenting methods of parents of children with behavioral disorders, he asked psychology and psychiatry experts to determine the validity of each sentence in the questionnaire. The result showed that the questionnaire has face validity. In order to determine the reliability of the questionnaire, he asked the studied population to complete the mentioned questionnaire and after a period of one week, the questionnaire was completed again by the same people. The reliability rate for the permissive style was 69%, for the dictatorial style was 77%, and for the decisive and reassuring style was 73% . Findings Among the women participating in the research, all were working women aged 30 to 45, and all answered the research questions completely. The results of Table  show that among the components of Corona anxiety, mental symptoms have the highest average. Among the quality-of-life components, physical health has the highest average. Finally, among the parenting styles, the assertive parenting style has the highest average among women.  The results of Table  show no significant relationship between parenting methods and Corona anxiety in the permissive style, a direct relationship in the authoritarian lifestyle, and a significant negative relationship in the authoritarian lifestyle. implemented correctly and women get confused, their corona anxiety will increase and vice versa. However, no significant relationship was observed between permissive parenting style and corona anxiety. This finding is in line with the results of Sadri and Samadieh's research (2020) that resilience and perception of parenting styles were significant predictors of Corona anxiety. In explaining this hypothesis, it can be said that families whose parents use their power and strictness a lot implement authoritarian parenting. Such families want their children to obey them at the moment without paying attention to their children's requests. As a result, it can be expected that parents who choose this method will show children with a higher level of anxiety because these children show extreme fear and anxiety in different situations. On the other hand, families that correctly use the logical decisive parenting method allow their children to have freedom of action to do their own things, which helps them develop high self-esteem and maturity. This logical control can help children to stay away from the negative effects of stress and poverty, which will reduce the anxiety of Corona. On the other hand, when the family does not implement this parenting style correctly, they create confusion about what decisions they should make and what they should do to achieve success. This causes mental pressure and problems, which cause the anxiety of Corona. Also, the results of the multiple regression test revealed that quality of life with an inverse effect and authoritarian parenting style with a direct effect had a significant relationship with Corona anxiety. It can be said that quality of life and autocratic styles can predict corona anxiety (high or low) in women. In the meantime, the quality of life has the greatest impact and predictor of Corona anxiety. Regarding the limitations of the research, it can be said that the findings of the current research should be viewed with caution. This research is based on self-report questionnaires and it was not possible to use a clinical interview. Also, the current research was conducted in women's society, which should be avoided to generalize to other strata. Arbitrary and logically decisive parenting methods have an effect on increasing the anxiety of corona in women. Therefore, it is possible to help students and families to choose the best educational and parenting methods by holding conferences, gatherings and necessary trainings for families. It is also possible to mention the preparation of necessary training programs and training workshops to improve the quality of life and reduce the anxiety of Corona in women. Accordingly, it is suggested to use the training necessary to increase the quality of life and reduce the anxiety of Corona, which will help to increase the quality of life of women.",

In regions of the world with the highest burden of unmet family planning need, the proportions are higher. Robust epidemiologic evidence demonstrates that interconception intervals less than 18 months, and most notably less than 6 months, are associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Based on this the World Health Organization recommends an interpregnancy interval of 24 months . An estimated 35% of adolescent mothers in the United States experience rapid repeat pregnancy within 2 years. These young women are more likely to experience adverse perinatal outcomes, are unable to attain an educational degree, and depend on public assistance programs . Some women are not offered immediate postpartum contraception planning in many countries around the world. This may be due to the fact that women are absorbed with the range of emotions and adjustments that precede and follow having a baby. However, despite such hesitations or barriers from providers and patients to discuss contraception and sexual behaviors, it is very valuable to explore birth spacing prior to and following a delivery, even in the immediate peripartum time.",

At the time of cesarean delivery, tubal ligation is an effective method, with minimal added morbidity or risk. Postpartum minilaparotomy is another excellent option and is typically completed during the same hospital admission as the delivery.

Among women who breastfeed elevated prolactin levels inhibit GnRH, preventing the pituitary from secreting follicular-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, which in turn maintain ovarian suppression and prevent ovulation. Prolactin levels rise 10-20-fold in response to latch and suckling of an infant to the breast and will remain elevated with regular breastfeeding for months. Some research has demonstrated that supplemental feeding of an infant is associated with decreased suckling and ovulation within 6 weeks.",

Women with a history of sexually transmitted infections or HIV can safely use an IUD, and antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended before IUD insertion. Women who are unmarried, nulliparous, or adolescents can safely use most contraceptives including IUDs.",

It is often convenient for both the woman and her clinician as most women are motivated to delay pregnancy for several months or years following a delivery . There are barriers to IUD and implant due to issues surrounding stock, payment, or provider skill set even among women who present for a postpartum visit to request contraception. IUDs may be placed at the time of a vaginal delivery by a skilled provider using sterile techniques. For women who request IUD insertion at the time of delivery, the risk of expulsion, symptoms, and follow-up should be discussed. When an IUD is placed immediately after a vaginal delivery, it should be done within 10 min of delivery of the placenta, and it may be subsequently expelled 20-30% of the time. There is some concern that the LNG IUD may have a higher expulsion risk than the copper IUD. When placed at the time of cesarean, it is expelled approximately 8%. When placed at a later interval greater than 4 weeks postpartum, the expulsion rate is 3-5% (Table ). The use of instruments, IUD modifications, and suturing the IUD in situ do not alter expulsion rates . Additionally, as the uterus involutes, the IUD strings may lengthen and extend out of the vagina. A patient should be educated that she may need to return to have the strings trimmed and should try not to remove the IUD accidentally. Contraindication to postplacental IUD includes intrauterine infection, uterine anomalies, hemorrhage, and cervical or uterine cancer.",

        "page_content": "There is a robust body of research demonstrating that IUDs and hormonal contraceptive arm implants are methods that are able to reduce unintended pregnancy rates because they are not user dependent or coitus dependent, removing the need for adherence or maintenance. IUDs and implants are collectively referred to as long-acting reversible contraceptive methods or LARC. They are placed and removed by a practitioner, are extremely discrete, and do not require any ongoing effort from the user. Additionally, return to fertility and conception can occur within days of removal of the device. LARC methods are not only the most effective contraceptive methods but also have the highest satisfaction, cost efficiency, and continuation rates when compared to other forms of family planning . Uptake of IUDs and the implant in the United States has almost tripled over the last decade. In 2002 less than 3% of women using contraception used an IUD or implant; in 2009 that increased to 8.5% women . The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that LARC methods are offered as the first-line contraception for the majority of women, including adolescents and women with complex medical problems. Increased uptake of these methods has the potential to decrease the rate of unintended pregnancy in the United States as well as around the globe . There are very few contraindications to immediate postpartum LARC. Institutions and healthcare systems should work to ensure that the resources, processes, and infrastructure are in place to offer LARC to postpartum women at the time of delivery.",

At 24 months continuation for the copper IUD was 77%, for the LNG IUD 79%, and for the implant 69%. Continuation for other short-acting methods including combined and progestinonly methods such as pill, patches, and shots, was 41%. Among postpartum patients continuation at 1 year for the copper IUD was 91 and 89% for the LNG IUD. For the implant it was 74% at 1 year postpartum . A cost parity and public health impact model in the United States demonstrated that the cost of paying for IUDs and the cost of paying for the IUDs and implants is offset by preventing approximately 191 unintended pregnancies per 1000 women. This type of dramatic public health impact supports expanded access to IUDs and implants in the immediate postpartum setting. This would offer compelling and cost effective benefits even if theoretic expulsion/discontinuation rates were as high as 70% or the 1 year continuation rate was as low as 30% .",

There are a wide variety of contraceptive options available, and all women, including adolescents, have the right to decline any method of contraception. LARC methods should be offered as first-line contraceptive methods and encouraged as options for most women.

The classes took place twice a week and lasted 60 minutes each. All exercises were performed on mats.

Although both groups reported a positive impact of Pilates on their perceived physical fitness, significantly more women in the sustained participation group reported an improvement in the psychological area (functioning in different social groups, coping with everyday difficulties). The author's observation of the group also confirmed that over time the respondents were more willing to participate in the classes, especially as a result of the positive changes they had noticed in terms of physical fitness and reduction of low back pain. The respondents also claimed that they enjoyed the classes which, apart from purely motor aspects, bring certain social benefits. By participating in a homogeneous group, the respondents had made friends they could socialise with in other contexts. Regular participation in the classes was also a welcome break from everyday life and the routine of professional work and household duties. The classes became something natural, voluntary and were an opportunity for them to focus only on themselves. The respondents also noticed that regular physical activity yielded many benefits, especially during middle adulthood.",

        "page_content": "In women, both in middle and late adulthood, the health-related and psychological benefits of engaging in a physical activity are important. Systemic and physiological changes associated with the pre-menopausal period, increased susceptibility to stress factors, excessive workload and household chores result in less leisure time and reduced physical activity. These factors affect the psychophysical condition of women and may have a negative impact on their self-esteem. Because women in the pre-menopausal and menopausal period experience not only bothersome somatic symptoms, but also -and equally often -emotional imbalance, decreased sense of physical attractiveness and decreased self-esteem, it seems necessary to provide them with holistic help. It should mainly aim at improving physical and mental well-being and improving the quality of life in the main areas of life such as family, work and social life [Bąk-Sosnowska, Skrzypulec-Plinta 2012].  demonstrated that self-assessment in relation to mental as well as physical health is decreasing with age.  suggest that active women, who participate in fitness club activities, are characterized by high self-esteem. These women also have a positive attitude towards the professional sphere, are better at coping with stressful situations and are more successful in interpersonal contacts, as team players and members of society. They also have a positive attitude towards themselves and others. They are more positive about their chances of completing their tasks, which increases their task-related motivation, which in turn helps them to achieve their goals. Hence, physically active people prove their ability to achieve their goals, to show initiative and creativity. Other authors emphasize that, regardless of motivations for undertaking physical activity, women achieve their intended goal, which gives them physical and mental strength, while the resulting satisfaction allows them to enjoy their professional and family life. On the other hand, women who do not exercise tend to suffer from greater nervousness and irritability and lower self-esteem . The author's own research also confirms the influence of Pilates on higher self-esteem. This was particularly noticeable during the period of sustained participation (51%). As regards key determinants of health, women from the experimental group most often mentioned the importance of exercise and maintaining appropriate body weight. All these aspects may have been contributed to the fact that health awareness of the respondents increased along with the duration of the programme.",

Women increasingly take up physical activity with a view to improving their health and quality of life.  confirm that physical activity has a significant impact on women's health (maintenance or improvement of well-being, improvement of motor fitness).

Additionally, it may contribute to mood enhancement. People who exercise notice not only changes in physical fitness, but also an increase in energy levels and a decrease in muscle tension . Although the healthy lifestyle fashion is on the rise, not all studies indicate the need for systematic, daily physical activity. According to the study by , working-age women tend to undertake physical activity once or twice a week. Walking is the most preferred form of physical activity. Only 8% of women report engaging in physical activity every day. Among rural residents the habit of physical exercise is much less frequent. Although studies indicate low levels of exercise, most female respondents, those living in cities as well as those from rural areas, regard their level of physical activity as fairly typical. The promotion of a healthy lifestyle among adults is important for successful aging.  argues it is necessary to make employers aware of the inevitability of population aging and to present health promotion as a tool of limiting its negative effects. The author's research indicates that the promotion of a proper lifestyle by employers (e.g. regular exercise) is an effective tool for improving the health of older workers (aged 55 and older). Research results indicate that organizations that employ older workers have the highest awareness of the aging process and its consequences, and they also see the point of investing in the health of their employees. In addition, they are more willing than companies which do not employ people over the age of 55 to analyze the health needs of all their staff, regardless of age, and have been more committed to health promotion in recent years, and implement such activities more intensively.",

As a concept intra-action raises methodological questions that are relevant both when studying practices and when designing for everyday use of technology, for it maintains that both subjects and objects should be taken into account and accounted for as bringing about agency. Karen Barad's notion of intraaction differs from the notion of 'interaction' that is more commonly used in design studies. Interaction implies a relation between pre-existing humans (subjects) and technologies (objects) in which agency is a human or a technological attribute . The notion of intra-action, in contrast, suggests that subjects and objects come into existence only when and as they encounter each other. Lucy Suchman  captures the distinction: \"Whereas the construct of interaction suggests two entities, given in advance, that come together and engage in some kind of exchange, intra-action underscores the sense in which subjects and objects emerge through their encounters with each other.\" [6, p. 267, original italics]. Thus, with the notion of intra-action, \"Nothing is delimited as a separate entity. Everything is always engaging something else, in specific ways designated by the concepts: intra-activity, i.e. matter and meaning, object and subject, nature and culture are all mutually articulated and mutually entangled.\" .",

We use intra-action as a starting point in our discussion of meetings between subjects and objects and the reconfigurings that come into being through them (intra-actions). We hope to understand how 'elderliness' and 'independence' come about through such intra-actions (performativity); how the design of care technologies create realities through inclusion and exclusion; and how these realities are enacted and acted upon by mundane artifacts, senior citizens, care workers, researchers, and their research methods.",

The implementation takes place in an effort to meet socio-economic challenges that follow from the so-called tidal-wave-of-elderly . These challenges are met by way of reorganizing health care services, moving them from public institutions into homes , . Besides meeting socio-economic challenges, smart homes bring about possibili-ties for living independently at home: \"Smart homes offer the promise of increased independence and reduced need for caregiver support in the home.\" ]. In order to live at home for as long as possible, older people come to live with digital devices such as alarms, detectors, and sensors that monitor bodily movements and/or (unwanted) phenomena such as smoke, water, and/or heat. These digital technologies communicate via Internet or mobile connections, and give feedback on computer screens, mobile phones, or other mobile devices according to predefined actions and/or the very absence of them . According to Lopez et al., \"Caring depends on some form of security. . It is a process of becoming, but one never quite gets there, as the safety provided by the home telecare service is always emerging, but never reached. That is to say, it depends on practices, technologies and bodies that follow different logicssecurity and careat the same time, in a delicate balance.\" .",

Simultaneously, these care technologies introduce an economy of normativity by which residents come to perform a specific caring self in order for the technology to remain a caring aid . That is (in pointing to an example with bed alarms, which we previously have used ): the act of leaving the bed during night and not returning within the programmed time frame prompts the triggering of an alarm. Such triggering is productive when the person needs help, but rather counter-productive if the person just wants to sleep somewhere else in the house . In this case, the person living at home materializes an object that can be measured by technology (see also ). In such measuring the heterogeneity of elderliness and independence is blurred. In other words, \"Multiple positions exist at the same time, which means that identities are shaped in tensions between various positions; thereby, identities are neither uniform nor fixed but fragmented ( ; ).\" ]. One such position comes about through intra-action with the care technology in the smart home. Thus, even though senior citizens use technology in their homes to support wellbeing and autonomy, it is also important to remember that they are not a uniform group; rather, they are a heterogeneous group with various wishes, demands, and expectations , who are situated in different spaces and time of different materialdiscursive entanglements .",

The intention of the project was to design services with and for senior citizens in order to facilitate their day-to-day life and support wellbeing. The theme in the workshop was A Good Day, and included activities and technologies used during a good day. Three seniors, Alma, August, and Beathe, and two facilitators participated in the workshop. At the time of the workshop, the seniors were between 68-79 years old. The seniors all lived in their own homes without help (neither manual nor digital domestic care services). The facilitators asked the participants to clarify some images (brought along by the researchers from magazines, newspapers, etc.) and their daily activities. The workshop was recorded after receiving permission to do so. The participative methods used were cartographic mappings, which consist of sharing the created visual narratives by telling the other participants about mappings and future scenarios. The empirical material used in this paper is from the last activity -\"imagining the future.\" However, the scenarios have to be considered in relation to the other activities and methods used during the entire process, that is, the doings and actions taking place in the workshop or in material-discursive practice . The cartographic mapping method, developed by , see also , was the first activity held after the participants and the project were introduced. In the mappings the participants illustrated a Good Day from the morning to the evening, activities they participate in, who they meet, what kind of technologies they use to facilitate their daily lives, etc. The method is inspired by both ethnographic studies and participatory methods used and developed in Participatory Design, see Fig. .",

Along these lines of thinking, there might as well be a blurring of the heterogeneity of users as described by Mort et al.  in their account of telecare. In the smart home, these users could be care personnel, residents, and relatives . With respect to this we could say that the design of digital domestic care technologies, as many other technologies, builds on an ideal user, which, in practice, is a mere image . A \"user\", or an old person or a care worker, in our case, is someone who becomes vis-à-vis technologya someone who comes to perform as a specific \"user\" in order for the technology to do its caring job. With this we could say that independence is performed and intertwined with the discourses of society; thus, we find it fruitful to include performativity in design efforts, also when it concerns digital domestic care technologies.",

Following this activity, the next concerned sharing their illustrations. After the seniors had shared their stories about a good day, Maria, one of the facilitators, continued the workshop saying, \"now, you have described your present day-to-day life, but can you imagine the future and how do you want life to be in the future and how do you expect things to work, then\".",

However, they located themselves in relation to today´s situation but were also able to imagine a higher degree of dependence on various kinds of digital domestic care technologies. Alarms, timers and sensors were technologies the seniors had relationships to although they were not dependent on them at the time when the workshop was held. In the imaginations, the participants situate themselves differently in relation to digital domestic care technologies. With a reading of their performances or intra-actions we identified both in-and exclusion and how both independency and dependency unfolds . Digital technologies' support and facilitation of remembering is not only a question of old or young. Both elderly and younger people are dependent on and use digital technologies. With the inclusion of mobiles and younger people remembering became not only a question for the workshop participants but also for other users. The participantsthe usersbecame subjects by identifying themselves with younger people . The body's presence, its lesser degree of mobility, and an increased dependence were also brought up in the participants' imaginations of their futures. When mobility, dependence, and embarrassment were included in the performances the importance of intimacy appeared. The necessity to design digital domestic care technologies to assist older people (bodies that lack both motor and cognitive abilities) in the bathroom, was important to them. Being sensitive to the more intimate aspects of everyday life is a question of in-or exclusion or where the boundaries are drawn in design of digital domestic care technologies , . An awareness of elderliness (as heterogeneous), of expertise (that of the old people with respect to their own life), and of normativity (which is inherent in design choices), will help designers to better appreciate that and how elderliness and independence are situated. This might help contest the image of an ideal user and to draw boundaries in design that include all aspects of old people´s daily life.",

We have been interested in understanding how 'elderliness' and 'independence' come about through intra-actions in which matter and discourse are accorded symmetrical analytical importance. In bringing  to serve as an analytical lens we have illustrated how the performance of independence is a process of becoming with digital care technology. Through such a reading there is no discrimination between subject/object. In other words, when performing elderliness in the smart home the person becomes an object to be sensed through its measureable presence or absence; independence becomes a specific, prescribed agency. Simultaneously, the technology becomes a subject with agency that acts (or not) on behalf of the object (the human). Subjects and objects, as such, are not prefixed from a standpoint of intra-action; rather, it is in their encounter with each other that they become and obtain their properties and boundaries . The performativity of elderliness and independence is two-fold in the reading of the smart house and the workshop participants' imaginations, in that both subjects and objects are put to work in order for a more mutual relationship to unfold. The ideal user was also contestedelderliness is situated and unstable; it comes into existence in intra-actions dependent on what is included or excluded in design. For example, when mobile phones were included remembering emerged as a question of old and young. Dependency on other subjects and objectshumans or technologiesmay also have implications for design, especially as a consequence of the human body's lack of abilities in particular contexts. Thus, it is a fruitful act to include more intimate aspects of day-to-day life when designing digital domestic care technologies. Older as well as younger people are subjects who become vis-à-vis digital technologies. Their being varies vary due to where they are located and what is included in the intra-actions.",

First of all, in moving the view of use and design from 'interaction' to 'intra-action' the awareness is steered towards an understanding of being as contingent and constituted through ongoing practices and activities, rather than as a prevailing attribute that is stable and located within a specific entity. Thus, we ask for 'changing the gender of design'  in line with a Feminist Technoscience methodology that does not separate the discursive from the material, and, which accounts for a heterogeneity of agencies . Within this we want to re-emphasize that there are no innocent positions. This also goes for care technologies; they are situated in use practices and are themselves practices of design. Thus questions about the inand exclusions inherent in designs have a bearing on the potentials for that which can or might become.",

In this respect, in a case 19 judged under the auspices of the Family Code, which is now repealed, the court has indicated that \"the legal presumption of paternity, on the grounds of which the child born during the marriage has the mother's husband as a father, can only be removed by an action of negation of paternity and not by the registration of the child at the civil status office in the name of the mother's concubine\". In the same sense, in a recent case 20 , the court underlined that \"the presumption of paternity takes effect irrespective of the child's act of birth, which could show, for example, that the child's father is someone else than the mother's husband or that the child's father is unknown. It was decided that the child born during the marriage benefits from a presumption of paternity, even if the father was not registered in the act of birth and did not bring the action in the negation of paternity\". For reason identity, it is stated in the same decision that, \"the child enjoys the presumption of paternity, even if the father was not registered in the act of birth, and the child conceived during the marriage but born after the marriage ceased or was dissolved, and his/her mother did not remarry before the date of birth. If the mother's husband is not registered in the civil status register as the child's father, an action may be brought to ascertain the applicability of the provisions of the New Civil Code, which provide for a presumption of paternity, and to ask for the rectification of the act of birth. This presumption creates in favor of the child a status of a child born by a married woman.\"",

Moreover, it is not illegal to decide, when any proofs other than a forensic expertise has been proposed and produced that the mother's husband may not be the child's father, that the court should reject the proof with expertise, considering that there are no indications that such proofs are useful. It should also be noted that, where the producing of the proof with expertise necessarily involves the presence of the parties, such as in the case of serological and dermatoglific expertise, the law does not mean to give any particular value to the behavior of the party refusing to appear before the specialist laboratory or institute, as in the case of refusal of the party to reply to the questioning or to appear proposed and agreed questioning. In the absence of such a legal provision, the judge could only, beyond his/her prerogatives, give, even with limited effects on the case judged, a certain value or significance of a party's refusal to allow forensic expertise to be carried out, but it remains the possibility of investigating the merits by other means of proof. Finally, although evidence of legal facts can in principle also be provided by presumptions, the basis for the solution of admitting an action in the negation of paternity solely on the mother's refusal to allow the forensic expertise to be carried out makes groundless the decision which would be given, for the law allows the judge to rely on the presumptions only when they have \"a certain weight\". But such a refusal of the mother could not be considered to permit such a serious conclusion as that her husband is not the father of the child, the interest to be protected-the one of the minorrequiring verifications and the producing of proofs that unequivocally makes the court's conclusion\".",
